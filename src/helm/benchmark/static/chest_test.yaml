  input: A 36-year-old immunocompetent male patient was admitted to the hospital with prolonged recurrent fever, cough, anorexia and weight loss. Admission investigations revealed anaemia, while renal and liver function were within normal limits. A chest radiograph showed patchy infiltrates and  cavitation in the right upper lobe. Microbiological and molecular tests in sputum were positive for  Mycobacterium tuberculosis and treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide  has been started. A few days later, the anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility test shows isoniazid  resistance. Which is the right treatment option for this patient?
  options:
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 6 months
  - Rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 6 months
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 2 months followed by rifampicin, and  pyrazinamide for 4 months
  - Streptomycin, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 2 months followed by rifampicin,  ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 4 months
  - Moxifloxacin, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 2 months followed by rifampicin  and moxifloxacin for 4 months
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The overall goals for treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are 1) to cure the individual patient, and  2) to minimise the transmission of M. tuberculosis to other persons. For this reason, the prescribing   physician is carrying out a public health function with responsibility not only for prescribing an  appropriate initial regimen but also for successful completion of therapy. Using rapid molecularbased tests, drug resistance can be confirmed or excluded within 1–2 days. Such tests are  available in many European countries and the results should be used to guide treatment. If  rapid drug susceptibility tests are not available, empirical treatment should be started. For initial  empiric treatment of TB, the patient was started on a four-drug standard regimen consisting in  isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and either ethambutol or streptomycin. Once the TB isolate  is known to be fully susceptible, ethambutol (or streptomycin, if it is used as a fourth drug) can  be discontinued.
    Recent global surveys have reported a trend toward an increasing number of cases of drugresistant TB. Isoniazid is an important first-line agent for the treatment of TB because of its potent early bactericidal activity. However, resistance to isoniazid is very common, with a  prevalence rate of 28% among previously treated cases and 10% among new cases. Studies have reported a low rate of treatment failure (2%) for isoniazid-resistant strains treated with an  initial regimen of 4 to 5 drugs containing rifampin for at least 6 months. Therefore, the American  Thoracic Society (ATS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Infectious Diseases  Society of America (IDSA) issued guidelines recommending initial treatment with a standard  4-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 2 months followed by  4 months 2 drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin). If there is isoniazid resistance treatment should  be continued with rifampicin pyrazinamide and ethambutol
    for a total of 6 months.

  input: Which of the following statements about CPAP treatment in OSAS is/are true?
  options:
  - CPAP is currently the most effective treatment for severe OSAS.
  - The CPAP therapeutic principle in OSAS is the application of positive pressure to splint the  pharyngeal lumen.
  - The nasal pressure required for treatment of OSAS depends on the number of respiratory  events.
  - The nasal pressure required for treatment of an OSAS patient depends on factors such as body  posture, alcohol ingestion or drug treatment.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - D
  rationale: CPAP is the recommended therapy in patients with moderate and severe OSA, and in those with  symptomatic mild OSA which does not respond to other interventions. The fundamental cause  of OSA is upper airway collapse and CPAP acts as a pneumatic splint to prevent this collapse.  There is no clear relationship between AHI and the pressure required to maintain airway patency  and correct AHI, but the pressure required may be increased in the supine position, during rapid  eye movement sleep, or after alcohol or sedative ingestion.

  input: Regarding Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients, which of the following  statement(s) is/are correct?
  options:
  - Most patients have CD4 counts <200 cells per μL at the time of diagnosis of their first episode  of P. jiroveci pneumonia.
  - Most patients with P. jiroveci pneumonia will have an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase  level.
  - Arterial blood gases in patients with P. jiroveci pneumonia frequently reveal respiratory alkalosis  and a widened alveoloarterial oxygen tension difference.
  - A normal chest radiograph rules out the diagnosis.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Two studies performed in the 1990s showed that a CD4 count of <200 cells per μL in patients  with HIV infection carries an increased risk of P. jiroveci pneumonia. In one of these studies,  over 95% of P. jiroveci pneumonia patients had a CD4 count of <200 cells per μL. Increased  serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is present in >90% of patients; a normal LDH has a high  negative predictive value. A widened alveoloarterial oxygen tension difference with hypoxaemia  is frequently seen in patients with P. jiroveci pneumonia. The resulting hyperventilation induces  hypocapnia with (compensated) respiratory alkalosis. About 25% of patients with P. jiroveci  pneumonia present with a normal chest radiograph.
- id: Q7
  input: A 32-year-old, HIV-positive man presents with dyspnoea, nonproductive cough and fever. Physical  examination reveals a temperature of 39.4°C; the chest examination is normal. His medical records  show that he was hospitalised to an AIDS ward 6 weeks ago during an unrecognised outbreak of  drug-resistant tuberculosis. Which of the following tests would be helpful in the evaluation of this patient?
  options:
  - A chest radiograph
  - Sputum culture for mycobacteria
  - A tuberculin skin test
  - An interferon-γ release assay
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  rationale: After close contact with a person with active tuberculosis, as in this case, active tuberculosis has  to be vigorously sought by microscopic sputum examination and culture, chest radiography, and  other clinical examinations as appropriate. The tuberculin skin test has no role in the diagnosis  of active tuberculosis because it cannot differentiate between latent and active disease; additionally, the tuberculin skin test is often falsely negative in HIV-infected patients due to their  impaired immune response. The same holds true for the interferon-γ release assay, although its  specificity for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is greater than that of the skin test.
- id: Q8
  input: Which of the following statements concerning the use of supplemental oxygen in patients with  COPD is/are correct?
  options:
  - Long-term oxygen therapy improves survival in patients with stable COPD with severe  hypoxaemia.
  - Continuous oxygen therapy decreases pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with stable  hypoxaemic COPD.
  - Continuous oxygen therapy decreases the level of polycythaemia in patients with stable hypoxaemic COPD.
  - Oxygen administration increases V′E in patients with acute hypoxaemic exacerbations of COPD.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Continuous oxygen therapy decreases the level of polycythaemia in patients with  stable hypoxaemic COPD. Long-term oxygen administration in stable COPD with significant hypoxaemia (i.e. PaO2 <7.33 kPa  (<55 mmHg)) has resulted in prolonged survival (Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group, 1980;  and Medical Research Council Working Party, 1981). Long-term oxygen administration also  results in slight decrease and then stabilisation of pulmonary artery pressure, due to a decrease  in pulmonary vascular resistance by reversing the vasoconstrictor effect of alveolar hypoxia.  Although not formally proven, it also results in a decrease in the level of polycythaemia, probably  due to a decrease in erythropoietin secretion secondary to better oxygenation. In patients with  either cor pulmonale or polycythaemia (haematocrit >55%), continuous oxygen therapy has  been shown to improve survival in patients with a resting PaO2 between 7.33 kPa (55 mmHg)  and 8.00 kPa (60 mmHg). Severe hypoxaemia
    is associated with increased V′E, and correction of hypoxaemia (or worse,  hyperoxia) may be associated with decreased V′E by removing the hypoxaemic stimulus; this  effect is more pronounced in chronic hypercapnic patients. Hypoventilation (with associated  hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis) seen in severe acute COPD exacerbations can be treated  only by noninvasive or, less preferably, invasive mechanical ventilation.
- id: Q9
  input: During resting tidal breathing, mean inspiratory airflow is greater than mean expiratory airflow. Which one of the following explains this finding?
  options:
  - Expiratory muscle activity
  - Increased turbulence
  - Decreased compliance of the respiratory system
  - Increased humidity
  - Increased airway radius
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Airflow is governed by the Poiseuille equation, which states that flow is inversely proportional  to the airway radius to the fourth power and the viscosity of the fluid. The radius of the airway  is increased during inhalation due to the fact that the airway parenchyma is tethered to the  airways; radial traction pulls the airways open. Humidity in the lower airways affects the airflow  but it is normally 100% during inspiration and expiration, and it has a negligible effect, while  small changes in the airway radius during inhalation and exhalation are magnified to cause  large changes in airway resistance. The changes in compliance during tidal breathing have only  a minimal effect on the difference between inspiratory and expiratory airflow.
- id: Q10
  input: In a study, pulse oximetry detected OSAS with a sensitivity of 70 % and a specificity of 96% compared  with polysomnography. Male sex and older age are known risk factors for OSAS. Which of the following conclusion(s) can be drawn from this information?
  options:
  - Polysomnography should be done to confirm sleep apnoea when pulse oximetry suggests the  presence of OSAS.
  - In a population of older men the positive predictive value of pulse oximetry is higher than in a  general population.
  - Pulse oximetry is an ideal screening tool for OSAS.
  - A positive test in a young woman is more likely to be false positive than in an older man.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - D
  rationale: Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly classify an individual as ‘diseased’ when compared  with a gold-standard, in this case the polysomnography. Therefore, if a test with even a low  sensitivity but a high specificity is positive, the disease is confirmed, and no test with a higher  sensitivity is warranted. The positive predictive value (PPV) is the percentage of patients with a positive test who actually  have the disease (table). Positive and negative predictive values (NPVs) are directly related to  the prevalence of the disease in the population. Assuming all other factors remain constant, the  PPV will increase with increasing prevalence and vice versa, the NPV decreases with increase in  prevalence. In general, screening tools should be highly sensitive in order not to miss affected  cases, but specificity should not be too low as too many false positive cases would require further evaluation. By contrast, confirmation tests are requested to be highly specific,
    in order not  to misclassify ‘healthy’ people as ‘diseased’.
- id: Q11
  input: A 45-year-old female is admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnoea and acute chest pain.  Fever and cough are not present on admission. The patient reports mild dyspnoea on exertion for  the past 2 years and an episode of pneumothorax 6 months ago. On admission, her blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, her heart rate is 100 beats per min and regular, and her respiratory rate is  32 breaths per min. Chest radiography reveals small bilateral pneumothoraces. CT shows multiple  round cysts involving the whole parenchyma; three micronodules, enlargement of axillary lymph  nodes and a renal mass were also detected. Which of the following statements about this case is/are correct?
  options:
  - The diagnosis requires lung histology.
  - Lung cysts are the hallmark lesion.
  - Echocardiography is recommended in the follow-up.
  - There is a strong association with female gonadotropic hormones.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - D
  rationale: 'Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease characterised by progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma by cysts, which are the hallmark lesion in LAM. Definite LAM  diagnosis can be made by lung histology or by the detection of characteristic lung CT lesions  associated with one of the following: angiomyolipoma, chylous effusion lymphangioleiomyoma,  lymph-node involvement or the tuberous sclerosis complex. In the evaluation of disease progression, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 6-min walk tests are recommended. Routine  screening for pulmonary hypertension is not recommended because pulmonary hypertension  has not been reported frequently in cohorts of patients with LAM. LAM occurs almost exclusively  in females of child- bearing age or in those receiving female gonadotropic hormones. This is  thought to be related to oestrogen receptors, which could be demonstrated on the abnormal  smooth muscle cells and that control cell growth and proliferation. Langerhans
    cell histiocytosis  is unlikely because of the kidney mass and the enlarged lymph nodes.'
- id: Q12
  input: A 47-year-old technician is evaluated for chronic cough and progressive dyspnoea on slight exertion. On pulmonary function testing, both FVC and FEV1 are 80% predicted, and TLCO is 35% pred.  Arterial blood gases show a pH of 7.45, PaO2 of 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) and PaCO2 of 4.4 kPa (33 mmHg).  The chest radiograph is remarkable for bilateral hilar enlargement and infiltrates of both lungs.  Chest CT confirms bilateral hilar adenopathy and patchy lung infiltrates, predominantly of the upper  lobes. A small pericardial effusion and small ascites around the liver are also noted. Bronchoscopy is  performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) reveals an elevated cell count of 760 cells per μL, with 6%  neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes and 61% macrophages. Bacterial cultures of the BAL fluid remain  sterile and no acid-fast bacilli are found. Mycobacterial cultures are pending. Transbronchial needle  aspiration of the hilar lymph nodes demonstrates multiple noncaseating granulomas. What would be the
    most appropriate next diagnostic evaluation in this patient?
  options:
  - 24-h urinary calcium excretion
  - Transbronchial lung biopsy
  - 6-min walking test
  - Echocardiography
  - Liver biopsy
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The patient suffers from stage 2 sarcoidosis confirmed by typical CT findings including bilateral hilar adenopathy and predominant upper lobe infiltrates; transbronchial needle aspiration  shows noncaseating granulomas characteristic of sarcoidosis. The severity of the dyspnoea, as  well as the hypoxaemia and the severe diffusion defect, are not sufficiently explained by the  stage 2 sarcoidosis. Small pericardial effusion and ascites may be signs of right heart failure, so  the patient should undergo echocardiography in search of sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary  hypertension (SAPH). SAPH is reported with a prevalence of 5–50% in patients with symptomatic sarcoidosis and can be treated with prostacyclins, bosentan and sildenafil. Prednisone  would be the initial therapy for symptomatic uncomplicated sarcoidosis, while infliximab is a  second-line treatment. Urine sampling to measure calcium excretion would be indicated if sarcoidosis induced hypercalcaemia was suspected. Transbronchial
    lung biopsy is superfluous because fine-needle  aspiration of mediastinal lymph nodes has already proven noncaseating granulomas. A 6-min  walking test is helpful to document the severity of the disease and the success of the therapy for  pulmonary hypertension, but it is not indicated for diagnostic purposes. Liver biopsy to confirm  a second organ involvement of sarcoidosis is not necessary if radiological findings and biopsy  results are characteristic for sarcoidosis.
- id: Q13
  input: A 75-year-old female is referred for dyspnoea on exertion and chronic cough that have worsened  progressively over the past 12 months. Pulmonary function testing reveals an FVC of 72%   predicted, FEV1 of 80% predicted and TLCO of 38% predicted. The chest radiograph shows bilateral  patchy infiltrates, mostly at the lung bases. On HRCT, bilateral reticular opacities and clustered  basal honeycombing are found. Open-lung biopsy reveals randomly distributed foci of usual   interstitial pneumonia surrounded by normal lung parenchyma. What is the most appropriate therapy for this patient?
  options:
  - Pirfenidone
  - Bosentan
  - Acetylcysteine
  - Prednisolone/azathioprine
  - Supportive care
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: This patient suffers from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that has worsened during the past  year. There are no signs of a current flare; corticosteroids may be used when IPF exacerbates.  The other treatments listed have not been shown to provide clinical benefit.
- id: Q15
  input: Which of the following statements regarding treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders is  correct?
  options:
  - Auto-adjusting nasal CPAP is superior to constant-pressure CPAP for suppression of apnoea/ hypopnoea.
  - Bilevel positive airway pressure therapy is preferable to CPAP in obesity hypoventilation syndrome without severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation.
  - Adaptive servoventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in nocturnal Cheyne–Stokes   respiration due to left heart failure.
  - Evidence from a nonrandomised study suggests a reduction of cardiovascular morbidity with  CPAP in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
  - CPAP reduces mortality in central sleep apnoea.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Although auto-CPAP is commonly used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome  (OSAS), algorithms with auto-adjusting treatment pressure did not consistently yield better  results than treatment with CPAP at a fixed pressure regarding apnoea/hypopnoea and oxygen  desaturations. Some studies showed higher patient preference and adherence with auto-CPAP  than with fixed-pressure CPAP. In obesity hypoventilation syndrome, impaired central respiratory drive plays an important  role. Nonetheless, timed bilevel positive airway pressure has not been shown to be superior to  CPAP. Both CPAP and bilevel positive airway pressure appear to be equally effective in improving  daytime hypercapnia in a subgroup of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome without  severe nocturnal hypoxaemia. Although adaptive pressure support ventilation can improve central sleep apnoea (CSA) and Cheyne– Stokes respiration (CSR) in heart failure patients, definitive data on the effect of
    this treatment on  mortality are not yet available. Preliminary results of the SERVE-HF trial even suggest that adaptive  servoventilation may be associated with a higher mortality in a subgroup of patients with CheyneStokes respiration due to congestive heart failure with a low left ventricular ejection fraction (<45%). In a large observational landmark study extending over several years, Marin et al. (2005) observed  that overall mortality and cardiovascular events were reduced in patients with OSAS regularly using  CPAP compared with untreated OSAS patients. The odds ratio for nonlethal cardiovascular events  or mortality varies from 2 to 7 for moderate-to-severe OSAS compared with non-OSAS controls.  A common methodological problem is finding an adequate control group for this type of analysis. Nocturnal CPAP has been shown to improve nocturnal CSR/CSA, oxygen saturation, left ventricular ejection fraction, sympathetic nervous system activity and 6-min walking distance in patients  with
    heart failure and CSR/CSA. However, CPAP did not prolong survival without heart transplantation during a 2-year follow-up in a large trial (Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for  Patients with Central Sleep Apnea and Heart Failure). Nevertheless, a post hoc analysis suggested  a survival benefit in the subgroup of patients in whom CPAP significantly lowered the AHI.
- id: Q16
  input: Which of the following statements concerning exudative pleural effusions is/are true?
  options:
  - In parapneumonic effusions, a pH ≤7.0 suggests a complicated or loculated effusion, which  may progress to empyema.
  - In contrast to low pleural fluid pH, pleural fluid glucose is usually normal in complicated parapneumonic effusions.
  - Lymphocytosis on pleural fluid differential cell counting often occurs in malignant or tuberculous effusions.
  - Adenosine deaminase levels of pleural fluid are often elevated in tuberculous effusions.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: In pleural effusion of unknown cause, diagnostic thoracocentesis may help in elaborating the  clinical diagnosis. The sampled pleural fluid should be sent for biochemical, microbiological  and cytological analyses. Biochemical analyses include determination of protein, pH, lactate  dehydrogenase and glucose levels. A pH <7.2 indicates a complicated parapneumonic effusion  or empyema but may also occur in oesophageal rupture, rheumatoid arthritis and malignant  neoplasm. Glucose levels are typically low in complicated parapneumonic effusions. Pleural  fluid acidosis reflects an increase in lactic acid and carbon dioxide production due to locally  increased anaerobic metabolic activity. Tuberculous pleurisy often causes lymphocytic effusions but lymphocytosis is also frequently  seen in other disorders like rheumatoid pleurisy, sarcoidosis and yellow nail syndrome, after  coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and in pleural malignancy such as metastases, mesothelioma or lymphoma.
    When tuberculosis is suspected, an elevated level of adenosine deaminase  (>40 U⋅L−1) in the pleural fluid confirms the diagnosis with a sensitivity of >90% and a specificity of 85%. In lymphocyte-predominant effusions, the specificity of adenosine deaminase for  tuberculosis reaches values up to 95%.
- id: Q17
  input: A 54-year-old man with ischaemic cardiomyopathy undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery  for severe proximal obstructive lesions. He is mechanically ventilated in pressure support mode  overnight. The morning after surgery, he has several pulmonary artery wedge pressure readings of  18 mmHg but his chest radiography shows no evidence of congestive heart failure. He undergoes  extubation and initially does well but 2 h later he experiences rapid onset of dyspnoea. His chest  radiography now shows pulmonary oedema. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia but no evidence of  myocardial ischaemia. Which of the following functional abnormalities related to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation is the most likely cause of the pulmonary oedema?
  options:
  - Increased left ventricular preload and afterload
  - Shift of the ventricular septum toward the left because of decreased intrathoracic pressure
  - Increased pulmonary vascular resistance
  - Increased intrapleural pressure during inspiration
  - Decreased right ventricular preload because of decreased intrathoracic pressure
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Cardiac dysfunction is one of the most frequent causes of weaning failure. Switching from  mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing can unmask latent left ventricular failure by  increasing preload and afterload, and thus induce pulmonary oedema. Cessation of mechanical ventilation decreases the intrathoracic pressure so that the venous return to the heart  (i.e. the preload) increases; the decreased intrathoracic pressure also increases the pressure  gradient between the left ventricle and the great arteries so that the left ventricular afterload  increases. Repeated pulmonary artery wedge pressure measurements of 18 mmHg strongly  suggest left ventricular failure that is kept latent by mechanical ventilation. Decreased intrathoracic pressure during spontaneous breathing will increase right ventricular  preload but there is no increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Therefore, there is no increase  in the pulmonary artery pressure and, secondarily, right ventricular
    systolic pressure that would  cause a shift of the ventricular septum toward the left, as is the case in severe pulmonary hypertension. Intrapleural pressure during inspiration in spontaneous breathing is negative.
- id: Q18
  input: Which of the following statements about cystic fibrosis is/are correct?
  options:
  - The most common mutation is Phe508del on chromosome 7.
  - Pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus and  Escherichia coli are found in early stages of the disease.
  - Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens leads to infertility in men with cystic fibrosis.
  - Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy (azithromycin) should be considered for patients who  are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane  conductance regulator (CFTR), the most frequent of which is the Phe508del on chromosome 7.  Deranged chloride transport leads to thick, viscous secretions in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine and reproductive tract. The symptoms include persistent pulmonary infection and pancreatic insufficiency. A positive sweat chloride test and/or genetic analysis confirm the diagnosis.  The viscous mucus also disturbs the embryological development of the vas deferens, which  leads to male infertility. As the disease progresses, but not in the early stages of cystic fibrosis,  bacteria such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, which are not seen in healthy lungs, colonise the  airways of cystic fibrosis patients. E. coli has only recently been recognised as a critical pathogen  in cystic fibrosis. Recent studies have shown that long-term, lose-dose macrolide therapy can  reduce frequency of
    exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients colonised with P. aeruginosa.
- id: Q19
  input: Which of the following statements concerning the management of diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the pleura is/are true?
  options:
  - Positron emission tomography is essential for staging if resection is planned.
  - The most useful chemotherapy consists of a combination of cisplatin plus pemetrexed or  gemcitabine.
  - Talc pleurodesis should be avoided because it creates additional pain.
  - Palliative surgery includes extrapleural pneumonectomy.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  rationale: Positron emission tomography is used to rule out extrathoracic metastasis in patients considered for pneumonectomy and decortication, or radical surgical treatment with extrapleural  pneumonectomy with en bloc resection of the pericardium and hemidiaphragm. Positron emission tomography should be performed before any pleurodesis. A combined first-line regimen using cisplatin and pemetrexed is considered the gold standard  for treatment. Gemcitabine and cisplatin may be used for patients who cannot take pemetrexed. Pleurodesis is useful in preventing recurrent effusions, and management of dyspnoea and pain.  Talc is preferred over other agents for pleurodesis. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of radical surgery for mesothelioma. Extrapleural pneumonectomy should only be performed in clinical trials, in specialised centres or as part of multimodal treatment, and is not part of a palliative approach. Palliative treatment is performed for  relief of dyspnoea and pain; local
    procedures include parietal pleurectomy or talc pleurodesis.
- id: Q20
  input: Which of the following conditions will tend to increase the ventilation/perfusion ratio (i.e. increase  West zone 1) and therefore the dead space ventilation in the top part of the lung?
  options:
  - A change in posture, from standing to lying down
  - Increase in positive end-expiratory pressure in a patient ventilated for acute respiratory distress  syndrome
  - Severe mitral stenosis
  - Pneumothorax
  - Rapid deceleration in a bungee jump
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: In West zone 1, there is a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion, with an absence of perfusion in a ventilated area, i.e. dead space. Ventilation/perfusion ratios differ with the distribution of air within the lung and the variation in blood flow due to the influence of gravity, which  causes a gradient in blood pressure between the top and bottom of the lung. In the upright  position, regional pulmonary arterial blood pressure ranges from 5 mmHg near the apex of the  lung to 25 mmHg at the base. Venous pressure falls to −5 mmHg at the apexes and rises to  +15 mmHg at the bases. In normal health, pulmonary arterial pressure exceeds alveolar pressure in all parts of the lung; hence, zone 1 is not observed. Mitral stenosis increases venous  pressure, reducing the tendency to develop West zone 1. Zone 1 is generally only observed when  a person is ventilated with positive pressure. In these circumstances, blood vessels can become  completely collapsed by alveolar pressure
    and blood does not flow through these regions, they  become alveolar dead space. Changing position from upright to supine, pneumothorax, and  deceleration in head-down position all tend to decrease the likelihood of West zone 1.
- id: Q23
  input: A 52-year-old woman known for poorly controlled asthma is referred to the emergency unit with  acute dyspnoea. On her chest X-ray, multiple infiltrates are seen on both lungs, prominently on the  lower parts. She also complains of weakness of her left arm and numbness of several fingertips on  both hands. Her urine is microscopically positive for red blood cells. Purpura is seen on her right  forearm and on her right ankle. Due to increasing dyspnoea despite bronchodilators, the patient is  referred to the intensive care unit. Which of the following statements regarding the confirmation or rejection of the suspected diagnosis is most appropriate?
  options:
  - A negative test for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (proteinase 3) would render it improbable.
  - '>10% eosinophils in the white blood cell count and elevated IgE would support it.'
  - A positive test for Jo-1 antibodies would support it.
  - A positive skin-prick test for Aspergillus would support it
  - A positive test for neuron-specific enolase would support it.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly called Churg–Strauss syndrome,  is part of the group of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitic diseases. It is characterised by late-onset asthma, hypereosinophilia, and systemic necrotising vasculitis of the small and middle-sized arteries with necrotising granuloma of the vessel walls and  extravascular tissue. Peripheral blood eosinophils >10% are a hallmark of this disease. Apart  from nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss and fever, different organ systems may be  affected. Asthma occurs in 95–100%, the upper airways are affected with rhinosinusitis and  polyps, and the lung parenchyma may be affected. Mononeuritis multiplex, cutaneous manifestations, and cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal and central nervous affections may occur during  the vasculitic phase. Myalgia may also occur in this phase. After the first description of EGPA in  1951, criteria were defined to allow for a diagnosis
    in the absence of a histological proof, which  is often difficult to make. Thus, if four out of six of the American College of Rheumatology criteria are fulfilled, the sensitivity and specificity for EGPA are 85% and 99.7%, respectively. ANCA  against myeloperoxidase (perinuclear ANCA) are positive in only 40–70% of cases; thus, a negative test cannot rule out EGPA. ANCA against proteinase 3 are more likely to be positive in EGPA.  Antisynthetase antibodies (anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA antibodies (Jo-1)) may be elevated in  idiopathic anti-inflammatory diseases with arthritis, myopathy and Raynaud’s syndrome that  can be associated with interstitial lung disease. A positive skin-prick test for Aspergillus would  be a marker of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, not EGPA. Neuron-specific enolase is an  immunohistochemical marker that occurs in neuroendocrine tumours such as carcinoids and  small cell lung cancer.
- id: Q24
  input: Which of the following is/are true in pleural effusions?
  options:
  - Low pleural fluid glucose (<3.4 mmol ⋅ L−1) is specific for a complicated parapneumonic effusion.
  - A complicated parapneumonic effusion by Proteus spp. may present with pH >7.5.
  - Small parapneumonic effusions (e.g. <10 mm thickness) may not require thoracentesis.
  - A positive Gram stain in a parapneumonic effusion indicates the need for chest tube drainage.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  - E
  - D
  rationale: A parapneumonic effusion is a pleural fluid collection adjacent to a pneumonia. A small parapneumonic effusion that does not require particular treatment other than antibiotics is called  a simple uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion. If bacteria and inflammatory cells invade the  pleural space, the pH becomes acidotic, glucose levels decrease (often to values <2.2 mmol⋅L−1)  and lysis of neutrophils results in increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (>1000 U⋅L−1 or >0.5  times the value in the serum). In this condition, pleural drainage is usually required. Bacteria  seen in the Gram stain of a pleural effusion confirm infection of the pleural space and this usually indicates empyema requiring drainage or even a surgical intervention. This indication for  chest tube drainage is often based on the presence of frank pus (indicating empyema) or a low  pH of the pleural fluid (<7.2), suggesting a complicated parapneumonic effusion. A low pleural  fluid pH and glucose concentration
    are not specific to parapneumonic effusions but may also  be present in effusions from other causes (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis). A parapneumonic effusion  from Proteus spp. may be alkalotic due to the production of ammonia from urea hydrolysis.

  input: A 25-year-old woman has had nearly continuous daytime sleepiness for 6 years. She either falls  asleep or ‘blacks out’ involuntarily several times a day, especially in business meetings, and has to  be awakened by colleagues. She has frequent nocturnal awakenings, sometimes associated with  nightmares. She has been told that she snores, although she now lives alone. A review of her symptoms is remarkable for a several-year history of almost daily ‘collapsing’ spells, lasting 20–30 s,  during which she feels her knees buckle, requiring her to sit for a few minutes. She is 152 cm tall,  weighs 70 kg, has a neck circumference of 43 cm, a blood pressure of 100/72 mmHg and an  other wise normal physical examination. What is the most appropriate next step?
  options:
  - Polysomnography
  - Polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep latency test
  - Oververnight screening pulse oximetry
  - Periodic office follow-up, and advice to avoid or eliminate obesity, sleep deprivation, and bedtime alcohol or sedative intake
  - Diagnostic psychiatric evaluation
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: OSAS and narcolepsy are the most relevant differential diagnoses for this case. Daytime sleepiness is common in both diseases. Frequent awakening and snoring, as well as the high body  weight (BMI 30 kg⋅m−2) and neck circumference could indicate OSAS. However, narcolepsy is  characterised by irresistible sleep attacks during the day, often at inappropriate times. Moreover,  it presents with typical symptoms of cataplexy with transient muscle weakness, which may  be triggered by emotions. The diagnostic evaluation includes polysomnography in order to  diagnose breathing disturbances during the night and the sleep profile. The typical finding of  narcolepsy is sleep-onset rapid eye movement (SOREM), which is not only measured during  polysomnography but also in multiple sleep latency tests (MSLTs). In persons with symptoms  suggestive of narcolepsy, including excessive sleepiness and cataplexy, the diagnosis is supported by a mean sleep latency in the MSLT of ≤8 min and two or
    more SOREM periods.

  - 'is offered a pulmonary rehabilitation  (PR) course immediately after discharge from hospital following an acute exacerbation of COPD. His  medical therapy has been optimised, but he is breathless on walking 200 m. The patient is sceptical  about participating in the PR course. In explaining the potential benefits to the patient, which one of the statements below is evidence  based? Pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and:'
  - Increase FEV1
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-based multidisciplinary and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory disease who are symptomatic despite optimal  medical therapy. Guidelines developed by ACCP/AACVPR indicate a strong (1A) recommendation that PR will improve health-related quality of life and decrease dyspnoea. There is no consistent evidence that PR reduces mortality in COPD. A randomised controlled trial has shown  that PR starting within 10 days of hospital discharge following an acute exacerbation of COPD  reduced admission rate for acute exacerbations within the subsequent 3 months compared  with the group receiving usual care without PR. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis  has shown a mild beneficial effect of multidisciplinary PR on mood.

  input: A 68-year-old male is admitted to the emergency room complaining about shortness of breath,  fever, chills and cough with purulent sputum production for the last 2 days. He is a nonsmoker  without any previous medical history. The patient looks tired but other than that he is in good  condition without any confusion. Vital signs are blood pressure 105/70 mmHg, heart rate  110 beats per min, breathing rate 32 breaths per min, and temperature 38.9 °C. Bronchial breath  sounds are heard on auscultation of the right chest. Blood tests reveal a white blood cell count of  9000 × 109 per L with a left shift, haematocrit 46%, urea 22 mmol⋅L−1, creatinine 160 μmol⋅L−1,  sodium 142 mmol⋅L−1 and oxygen saturation (room air) 92%. A chest radiograph demonstrates  moderate cardiomegaly and a right lower lobe infiltrate with air bronchograms. Which one of the following is the appropriate management decision for this patient?
  options:
  - Treat as an outpatient, start empirical antibiotic therapy without further examinations
  - Treat as an outpatient, take blood and sputum cultures, start empirical antibiotic therapy
  - Admit to hospital, start empirical antibiotic therapy within 4 h of admission
  - Admit to hospital, take blood and sputum cultures and Gram stains, start antibiotic therapy  according to results
  - Treat in the intensive care unit, start empirical antibiotic therapy
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: 'Pneumonia is a condition caused by microbial infection within the lung parenchyma. Pneumonia  is classified according to the origin as community-acquired (CAP) or hospital-acquired (nosocomial pneumonia (NP)). According to the definition, CAP occurs in the absence of immune  compromise or prior hospital admission within the previous 7 days. The decision regarding the  most appropriate site of care, including whether hospitalisation of a patient with CAP is warranted, is the first and single most important decision in the overall management of CAP. This  decision is best performed by an accurate assessment of the severity of illness at presentation  and the likely prognosis. Clinical assessment of disease severity is dependent on the experience  of the attending clinician but such clinical judgement has been shown to result in apparent  underestimation of severity. Therefore, various severity scoring systems and predictive models  have been developed in an attempt to help the
    clinician identify patients with pneumonia and a  poor prognosis at an early stage. The six-point CURB-65 score, one point for each of confusion,  urea >7 mmol⋅L−1, respiratory rate >30 breaths per min, low systolic (<90 mmHg) or diastolic  (≤60 mmHg) blood pressure and age >65 years, is based on information available at initial   hospital assessment and enables patients to be stratified according to increasing risk of mortality (score 0: 0.7%; score 1: 2.1%; score 2: 9.2%; and scores 3–5: 15–40%). Patients who have  a CURB-65 score of 3 or more (as the patient in this question, with a CURB-65 score of 3) are  at high risk of death. These patients require urgent hospital admission. Patients with CURB-65  scores of 4 and 5 should be assessed with specific consideration to the need for transfer to a  critical care unit (high dependency unit or intensive care unit). Microbiological tests (blood and  sputum cultures) are recommended in patients with moderate and high severity CAP admitted  to
    the hospital. All patients should receive antibiotics as soon as the diagnosis of CAP is confirmed. The objective for any service should be to confirm a diagnosis of pneumonia with chest  radiography and initiate empirical antibiotic therapy within 4 h of presentation to the hospital.'
- id: Q29
  input: A patient on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome develops a right-sided  pneumothorax. Which of the following measures should be taken at this time?
  options:
  - Pleural puncture and aspiration of the pleural air
  - Double-lumen intubation and reduction of positive end-expiratory pressure
  - Insertion of a small-bore chest tube
  - Surgical closure of the leak by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
  - Increase in inspiratory oxygen fraction by 10%
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Positive pressure ventilation carries an elevated risk of barotrauma. The rupture of the alveolar wall due to increased transpulmonary pressure results in air leakage that causes either a  pneumothorax or a pneumomediastinum. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is known to be  an independent risk factor for pulmonary barotrauma. If pneumothorax develops in patients  on positive pressure mechanical ventilation, it may rapidly progress to a tension pneumothorax, causing cardiovascular failure; therefore, pneumothorax should be alleviated promptly after  its discovery. The recommended practice is the insertion of a chest tube for pneumothorax  developing during mechanical ventilation because of the risk of the development of a tension  pneumothorax. The general consensus recommends a small-bore chest tube as the first choice  because it works well and with fewer complications than large-bore tubes. Manual aspiration  with thoracentesis has not been studied in intensive care setting
    and is not recommended  because it does not allow continuous drainage of the air leak. If persistent air leakage is observed  for 3–5 days, surgical intervention should be considered. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery  is preferred to open thoracotomy based on a non-evidence-based Delphi consensus statement  in the American College of Chest Physicians guideline. Increasing the inspiratory oxygen fraction  and decreasing the positive end-expiratory pressure may slow down the further development of  the pneumothorax but are insufficient measures to prevent a tension pneumothorax.

  input: A 45-year-old banker complains of dyspnoea when he climbs the stairs to his office on the third  floor. When he reaches the second floor, his chest feels tight and several times he has almost  fainted so that he had to sit down until he recovered. 5 years ago, he fractured his right ankle at  a golf tournament. The fracture was complicated by a deep vein thrombosis of the right leg with  concomitant pulmonary embolism. On lung function testing, lung volumes are normal and TLCO is  35% predicted. SpO2 on room air is 86%, and arterial blood gas analysis reveals a PaO2 of 7.6 kPa  (57 mmHg), PaCO2 of 4.0 kPa (30 mmHg) and pH of 7.47. Echocardiography shows a normally functioning left ventricle; the right ventricle is dilated and the systolic pulmonary pressure is estimated  to be 50 mmHg. Which of the following is the next appropriate step in the management of this patient?
  options:
  - MRI angiogram (angio-MRI) of the chest
  - Pulmonary angiography combined with right-heart catheterisation
  - Start therapy with prostacycline
  - Coronary angiography
  - Start therapy with sildenafil
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The patient suffers from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) after pulmonary embolism 5 years ago. Pulmonary angiography should be performed to evaluate the  patient for surgical thrombendarterectomy of the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary angiography  combined with right-heart catheterisation remains the reference standard for the diagnosis and  determination of surgical accessibility of CTEPH. Therapies with prostacycline and sildenafil are  second line, either after partial successful surgical thrombendarterectomy or if thrombendarterectomy cannot be performed.

  input: A 48-year-old female with a 25 pack-year history of smoking presents with fever, cough and purulent  sputum production and her chest radiograph shows consolidation of the right middle lobe. She has  a history compatible with chronic bronchitis but normal spirometry and she had a bronchitis exacerbation 2 months ago for which she received treatment with moxifloxacin. Her blood pressure is  115/75 mmHg, her breathing rate is 18 breaths per min. She does not look severely ill but she is  depressed and tired because she has spent long hours with her mother who was at a home for the  elderly and died a week ago, 2 weeks after acquiring an influenza infection. The patient is anxious  to get well soon and return to work because she has already taken a long time off. Which one of the following is the appropriate treatment for this patient?
  options:
  - Amoxicillin-clavulanate and macrolide
  - Oseltamivir
  - Moxifloxacin
  - Piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin
  - Acyclovir and amoxicillin-clavulanate
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: The patient has been exposed to a hospice environment and therefore this is healthcare-related  pneumonia. Her pneumonia involves one lobe only, the patient is not severely ill and has no  increased risk, so, according to the guidelines, she can be treated with an aminopenicillin  plus β-lactamase inhibitor, a second generation cephalosporin or a respiratory quinolone. This  patient has had treatment with a quinolone less than 3 months ago and she should not be  treated with moxifloxacin. She has been exposed to influenza but that was more than 2 weeks  ago and, therefore, this is too long for her to develop influenza. Aciclovir is used for the treatment of herpes infections and therefore is not indicated here. Piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin are indicated for healthcare-related pneumonia but when risk factors for multi-drug  resistance are suspected or after a long hospitalisation. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and macrolide is  appropriate as this treatment covers streptococcal
    infection which is still very probable.

  input: A 35-year-old English female with a 3-month history of lethargy and increasing dyspnoea went  on holiday to Mallorca, Spain, where she became unwell with nausea, vomiting, polyuria and  confusion. A chest radiograph showed diffuse reticular opacities of the lung with bilateral hilar  lymphadeno pathy.  Which one of the following investigations would be most useful in guiding her acute management?
  options:
  - Serum calcium
  - Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
  - Serum amylase
  - Chest CT
  - Head MRI
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: The chest radiograph suggests a diagnosis of sarcoidosis and the history indicates active disease.  The acute symptomatology is consistent with hypercalcaemia, which is likely to have developed  because of exposure to sunlight on holiday. Hypercalcaemia is known to complicate sarcoidosis  and other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis. The defect in calcium metabolism  is due to extrarenal production of calcitriol by activated macrophages. Serum angiotensinconverting enzyme level may support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis but would not help acute  management. Serum amylase may indicate pancreatitis, which may occur in hypercalcaemia,  but the symptoms in this case do not suggest pancreatitis. Chest CT may better define the  extent of the sarcoidosis but would not contribute to the acute problem. Head MRI may indicate  neurosarcoidosis but the history does not suggest that. Management of hypercalcaemia in sarcoidosis involves reducing calcium intake (≤400 mg⋅day−1),  reducing
    oxalate intake, eliminating dietary vitamin D supplements and avoiding sun exposure.  Intravenous fluid administration to correct dehydration and loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide)  promote renal excretion of calcium. The use of corticosteroids in granulomatous diseases is  thought to be beneficial through inhibition of 1-α-hydroxylase in activated macrophages.

  input: A 22-year-old patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is ventilated at home with a bilevel pressurecycled ventilator. Following a lower airway infection, he experiences great difficulty in clearing bronchial secretions. Of the following treatments, which one is recommended in this case?
  options:
  - Increasing ventilator inspiratory positive airway pressure
  - Regular use of an oral mucolytic agent
  - Regular use of nebulised 3% saline
  - Bronchial secretion clearance with mechanical insufflation–exsufflation
  - Suction of pharyngeal secretions
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is characterised by inspiratory and expiratory muscle weakness.  During a chest infection, secretions are difficult to clear because of ineffective coughing. While  increasing inspiratory airway pressure on a bilevel pressure-cycled ventilator may improve control of ventilatory failure, and the use of nebulised saline and a mucolytic agent may improve  sputum rheology, the use of suction in the upper airway and mouth will not clear lower airway secretions. The cough insufflator–exsufflator augments peak cough flow and is the most  effective way of clearing secretions. The combination of NIV and cough insufflator–exsufflation  reduces pulmonary morbidity, and may decrease the need for tracheostomy.

  input: Which of the following radiographic features is least likely to be found in Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis  of the lung?
  options:
  - Diffuse nodules ranging in size up to 10 mm
  - Diffuse reticulonodular opacities
  - Pneumothorax
  - Pleural effusion
  - Honeycomb lung
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis (LCH) of the lung is characterised by stellate nodules (2–10 mm  in size) and reticular and nodular opacities with a predominantly bilateral symmetric upper- to  mid-lung distribution; the costophrenic angles are usually spared (see figure). When the disease  progresses, cysts develop and may become the dominant imaging finding. Cysts vary in size but  usually are smaller than 1 cm. A confluence of cysts may result in bullous formation, which then  predisposes the patient to recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. In advanced LCH, honeycomb  changes can occur. Pleural effusions are rare findings.

  input: A 46-year-old nonsmoking patient suffers from recurrent purulent bronchitis. He complains of  increased sputum production but is otherwise well. A CT scan shows bilateral, mainly lower lobe  tubular bronchiectasis. Which of the following investigation(s) is/are important for treatment decisions?
  options:
  - Search for nontuberculous mycobacteria in sputum
  - α1-antitrypsin serum level
  - IgG and subclasses levels in serum
  - Bacterial sputum cultures
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Risk factors for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections include chronic lung diseases,  such as bronchiectasis and COPD, and various forms of immunodeficiency. When NTM are  inhaled by susceptible individuals, infection can lead to a chronic progressive and sometimes  fatal lung disease. α1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is classically associated with predominantly lower lobe emphysema. Bronchiectasis has also been associated with the enzyme deficiency. Whether this is  a direct consequence of the deficiency or secondary to the emphysema-associated airway  obstruction is not clear. In a study of patients with severe AAT-deficiency, the vast majority of  subjects had some evidence of bronchiectasis on a high-resolution CT scan (70 out of 74 subjects). However, AAT augmentation therapy is not indicated in the described patient. Although it  has been demonstrated to slow the progression of emphysema in CT studies AAT augmentation  has no role in the therapy of bronchiectasis.
    Immunodeficiencies may predispose to bronchiectasis. The immune defects most strongly associated with bronchiectasis are those resulting in hypogammaglobulinaemia. These include the  primary immunodeficiencies, common variable immunodeficiency and X-linked agammaglobulinaemia and the secondary immunodeficiencies caused by lymphoproliferative malignancy,  allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and chemo-immunotherapy. Conditions resulting in  T-cell dysfunction e.g. HIV infection or immunosuppression, reduced bacterial opsonisation,  complement deficiencies, failure of phagocyte migration (leukocyte adhesion deficiency) and  impaired intracellular killing of bacteria (chronic granulomatous disease) may also predispose  to bronchiectasis. Sputum microbiology is a key investigation tool in the diagnosis of patients with bronchiectasis. Haemophilus influenzae is the most frequently isolated pathogen and found in up to  35% of patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella
    catarrhalis and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also commonly identified. Aspergillus sp. may also be found and  may be associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The presence of P. aeruginosa  in sputum from patients with bronchiectasis is associated with more severe lung disease and  may also indicate a worse prognosis.

  input: A 55-year-old secretary has been diagnosed with OSAS based on excessive sleepiness (Epworth  sleepiness score 14) with frequent episodes of dozing off at work, habitual snoring and an AHI  of 36 events per h during polysomnography. Her BMI is 29.3 kg⋅m−2 and her blood pressure is  125/75 mmHg. Oral inspection reveals a Mallampati score of I with normal tonsillar size and normal  teeth. There is a deviation of the nasal septum to the right and she seems to breathe predominantly  through the left side of the nose. Treatment with nasal CPAP is explained and recommended to  the patient. However, she declares that she would under no circumstances use any treatment that  required wearing a mask. Which one of the following treatments is the most effective alternative treatment modality for this  patient?
  options:
  - Surgical correction of nasal septum deviation
  - Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
  - Sleep hygiene and weight loss
  - A mandibular advancement device
  - Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Nocturnal application of CPAP therapy is the main treatment for OSAS. CPAP has been shown  to improve symptoms including excessive sleepiness and quality of life. In addition, it lowers  blood pressure in hypertensive patients and there is some evidence that the risk of traffic accidents might also be reduced. However, certain patients are unable or unwilling to use CPAP  and require an alternative treatment. Sleep hygiene (i.e. regular sleeping hours and sufficient  sleep time), avoidance of alcohol in the evening and smoking cessation are commonly recommended as adjuncts to CPAP, but these measures alone have little effect on nocturnal breathing  disturbances. In a randomised study in patients with mild-to-moderate OSA, the effectiveness  of sleep hygiene and recommended weight reduction alone or combined with either a mandibular advancement device or CPAP were evaluated. Mandibular advancement devices were  significantly more effective in improving quality of life domains
    and the AHI. Several other  randomised, sham-controlled studies confirm that mandibular advancement devices improve  sleep disordered breathing, daytime sleepiness, quality of life and objective vigilance, and  reduce blood pressure in OSA patients. In patients with severe OSA, mandibular advancement  devices may not perfectly control sleep-related breathing disturbances but are superior to no  treatment at all. Although uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) has been performed for many years for snoring  and OSA, there is no evidence from randomised studies that supports its effectiveness. In one  study randomising OSA patients to either treatment with a mandibular advancement device  or UPPP, control of sleep apnoea was superior in the group receiving a mandibular advancement device at 1 and 4 yrs follow-up. A randomised sham-controlled study revealed no benefit  of laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty compared with a sham operation. Since there are no studies indicating a clear benefit of UPPP
    or laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, these procedures are  not recommended as treatments for OSA. Although nasal obstruction may promote snoring  and disturb sleep, studies indicate that treating nasal obstruction with nasal decongestants,  topical steroids or surgery have very little effect on sleep-related breathing disturbances in OSA  patients. Nevertheless, these treatments may be of some use as adjuncts to CPAP therapy or  mandibular advancement devices.

  input: A 66-year-old Dutch woman presents with 3 weeks of cough and sputum production, with haemoptysis and 2.3 kg weight loss in 1 month. She has a history of multiple episodes of childhood  pneumonia. She does not smoke but says that she has had a chronic cough for 5 years, present  throughout the day, with daily sputum production. Several times a year, she receives antibiotic  therapy for purulent sputum. Her tuberculin skin test was positive 20 years ago. Chest radiography shows increased markings at the lung bases with ‘tramlines’ and dilated bronchial shadows.  Furthermore, an infiltrate with a 1-cm thin-walled cavity in the right upper lobe is seen. A sputum  smear for acid-fast bacilli is positive. Which of the following should be the next step in the management of this patient?
  options:
  - Start therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol.
  - Collect two additional sputum samples, and start therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide.
  - Collect two additional sputum samples for mycobacterial smears and culture, then start therapy with rifampicin, ethambutol and clarithromycin.
  - Collect three additional sputum samples for mycobacterial smears and culture, then await  results before starting therapy.
  - Perform bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy before starting therapy.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The patient’s history and chest radiography suggest that she has bronchiectasis, probably due  to recurrent bacterial bronchial infections during childhood. Furthermore, she had latent tuberculosis in the past, as evidenced by her positive tuberculin skin test 20 years ago. She also has a  thin-walled cavity in her right upper lobe, a sputum smear showing acid-fast bacilli, and a recent  history of coughing with sputum production and considerable weight loss. These findings are  suggestive of tuberculosis. A differential diagnostic consideration should be a nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. In light of this, additional sputum cultures should be collected (in total, at least three  sputum samples should be collected, one of which is a morning sample) and then treatment  against tuberculosis should be initiated. This treatment should be adjusted if the results of the  definitive sputum cultures and resistance patterns warrant this. A rapid diagnostic test for resistance
    patterns might be performed if available, particularly in a  setting with a high likelihood of resistance. This is not the case for this patient. If tuberculosis is suspected, therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol  should be initiated. Furthermore, at least two additional sputum samples should be collected. In the case of possible active tuberculosis, one should not wait until the results of the definitive  cultures are available, as this may take several weeks. A transbronchial biopsy is not necessary  to diagnose an active tuberculosis or NTM infection in this case.

  input: A 60-year-old female is referred to you because of a subpleural noncalcified solitary nodule with  sharp borders and a diameter of 7 mm in her right lower lobe. The nodule was detected on an  abdominal CT performed to evaluate abdominal pain. Endoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer as  cause of the abdominal pain. The patient does not have any respiratory complaints. She stopped  smoking 30 years ago after an exposure of approximately 15 cigarettes per day for 15 years. What is the most appropriate next step?
  options:
  - Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy
  - Positron emission tomography
  - No follow-up needed
  - Thoracoscopic resection of the nodule
  - Follow-up CT in 3–6 months
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: According to the Fleischner Society criteria, nodules such as the one described (7 mm in diameter)  are supposed to be followed up after 3–6 months in high-risk patients. High-risk patients are  defined as patients with a history of smoking or other known risk factors. If there is no change  in the follow-up scan there should be repeated scans at 9–12 months and at 24 months.

  input: Which of the following statements concerning β-adrenergic blockers and inhaled β-adrenergic  agon ists is/are correct?
  options:
  - β-blockers are contraindicated in patients with COPD.
  - Administration of inhaled short-acting β-adrenergic agonists decreases heart rate.
  - Administration of inhaled short-acting β-adrenergic agonists can lower serum potassium.
  - β-blockers increase in-hospital mortality in asthma patients with acute myocardial infarction.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Administration of inhaled short-acting β-adrenergic agonists can lower serum  potassium. β-adrenergic agonists are often used in patients with cardiovascular disease. While they  should be used cautiously in patients with severe asthma, they can safely be used in COPD.  Meta-analyses have shown a small but significant reduction in FEV1 in patients with COPD  on β-blockers. Large retrospective databases suggest an improvement of prognosis in patients  with COPD being treated with β-blockers. Administration of inhaled short-acting β-adrenergic   agon ists induces tachycardia and lowers serum potassium. On chronic treatment, there is  tachyphylaxis concerning these effects. The use of cardio-selective β-blockers has been shown  to reduce in-hospital mortality in asthma patients after an acute coronary event.

  input: A 65-year-old former smoker with COPD of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease  grade 3, group D, is referred to the intensive care unit because of an acute exacerbation of his  disease, presenting with increased dyspnoea and purulent sputum. Despite inhalation of salbutamol, intravenous antibiotics and corticosteroids, his condition worsens gradually over 30 min. He  has not eaten or drunk for the last 5 h. On arterial blood gas analysis, pH is 7.25, PaO2 is 6.6 kPa  (49.5 mmHg) and PaCO2 is 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg). He is agitated but cooperates with inhalation and  opens his eyes on request. His respiratory rate is 26 breaths per min. Which therapeutic option is most appropriate in this situation?
  options:
  - Start NIV and oxygen
  - Start CPAP and oxygen
  - Intubate and start mechanical ventilation
  - Add salbutamol i.v. and low-dose (2.5 mg) morphine i.v.
  - Add inhaled short-acting anticholinergic and low-dose (2.5 mg) morphine i.v.
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: NIV should be used in exacerbations of COPD when pH is <7.35 and PaCO2 is >6.0 kPa  (>45 mmHg). Although the case presented here shows severe acidotic decompensation, a NIV  trial is warranted under intensive care unit conditions, as even a failed trial of NIV leading to a  delayed endotracheal intubation does not lead to higher mortality. The efficacy of NIV in treating acute exacerbations of COPD was studied in a European, randomised, multicentre study  conducted in 85 COPD patients assigned to receive conventional treatment (oxygen therapy  plus drugs) or NIV. The group of patients treated with NIV had fewer intubations (26% versus  74%, p<0.001), fewer complications (14% versus 45%, p<0.01), shorter length of hospital stay  (23±17 versus 35±33 days, p<0.02) and lower mortality (9% versus 29%; p<0.02). CPAP has not  been extensively studied in COPD exacerbations. CPAP would not actively support ventilation  so hypercapnia would not be expected to improve; therefore, bilevel
    NIV is preferred. The other  therapeutic options are not expected to correct respiratory acidosis but instead, could further  add to acidosis due to the ventilatory depressant action of morphine.

He expectorates greyish sputum,  mainly in the morning. These symptoms have been present for the past 1–2 years. He has reduced  smoking to only five cigarettes per day in recent years but has a smoking history of 30 pack-years.  He is on no regular medication and has not been hospitalised in the past decade. Physical examination shows no abnormality. Post-bronchodilator spirometry shows an FEV1 of 72% predicted and  a FEV1/FVC ratio of 61%. Which of the following actions is/are appropriate?
  options:
  - An inhaled long-acting bronchodilator is indicated to improve symptoms.
  - An inhaled corticosteroid should be started to prevent exacerbations.
  - Since the patient has reduced smoking to only five cigarettes per day, smoking cessation will  have no relevant effect on lung function decline.
  - Yearly influenza vaccination should be administered.

  rationale: The patient has Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade 2 COPD, i.e.  moderate COPD, without comorbidities or exacerbations, and with few symptoms. According  to a combined assessment of COPD, this patient is in group A (low risk and mild symptoms).  Either a short-acting bronchodilator as needed or a regular long-acting bronchodilator should  be prescribed to alleviate symptoms. This can be either a β-adrenergic agonist or long-acting  anticholinergic agent. Inhaled corticosteroids are recommended in symptomatic patients with  COPD of GOLD grade 3 or 4, or in those with a history of at least two exacerbations in the last  year (groups C and D). This does not apply to this patient. Exposure to even a moderate amount  of smoke represents a trigger for ongoing airway inflammation. Therefore, complete cessation  of smoking is essential to delay the progress of COPD. In COPD of grade 1–4, influenza vaccination reduces serious illness and death by about
    50%. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for COPD patients by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  despite insufficient data.I36

  input: A 62-year-old male complains of shortness of breath on mild exertion, such as climbing one flight  of stairs. He has no chest pain. The referring general practitioner reports that the patient has a  long history of arterial hypertension and a previous myocardial infarction with subsequent heart  failure. Accordingly, the patient is on a β-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and  a diuretic. The last echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. The Epworth  Sleepiness Scale reveals a score of 11. His wife reports that he is snoring irregularly with intermittent pauses. The patient has a BMI of 34 kg⋅m−2, no signs of oedema and the lungs are clear.  Spirometry reveals a vital capacity of 92% predicted and FEV1 of 94% predicted with a normal  flow–volume loop. Which of the following is/are correct?
  options:
  - In this kind of patient, pulse oximetry can reliably distinguish between OSA and Cheyne–Stokes  respiration.
  - The patient most likely suffers from moderate-to-severe OSA.
  - If polysomnography confirms moderate-to-severe OSA, CPAP has the potential to improve the  ejection fraction.
  - If polysomnography shows OSA, adaptive servoventilation is the treatment of choice.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  rationale: If polysomnography confirms moderate-to-severe OSA, CPAP has the potential to  improve the ejection fraction. Patients with heart failure sleep apnoea commonly have OSA and, to a lesser extent, central sleep apnoea/Cheyne–Stokes respiration. This is especially true for male and overweight  patients. Pulse oximetry cannot reliably distinguish between obstructive and central sleep  apnoea. Three out of four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed an improvement of left  ventricular function with CPAP in patients with OSAS and heart failure. The heart failure guideline of the European Society of Cardiology endorses the use of CPAP in this subset of patients  (strength of recommendation IIa; strength of evidence C). Recommended initial treatment of  OSAS in heart failure patients is CPAP not adaptive servoventilation (ASV) or automatic CPAP.  A small proportion of patients with heart failure and OSAS will show central sleep apnoea even  during 3 months of CPAP. Treatment in this
    setting is not established. The routine use of ASV in  patients with heart failure and central sleep apnoea is not recommended at present.

  input: A morbidly obese lorry driver (BMI 47 kg⋅m−2) is referred to the sleep laboratory because of excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep study reveals an AHI of 36 events per h and the oxygen desaturation index is 30 events per h. Mean nocturnal oxygen saturation is 86% and the saturation never  rises above 90% during the night. An arterial blood gas analysis reveals PaO2 7.05 kPa (53 mmHg),  PaCO2 9.05 kPa (68 mmHg) and pH 7.42; bicarbonate is 34 mmol⋅L−1. Pulmonary function testing  reveals a mild restrictive ventilatory disorder. Which of the following would be the appropriate initial therapy for this patient?
  options:
  - Nocturnal bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation
  - Nocturnal supplemental oxygen at 2 L⋅min−1
  - High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy
  - Acetazolamide at bedtime
  - Adaptive servoventilation
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: The patient suffers from obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with a chronic compensated  respiratory acidosis. OHS is defined as daytime alveolar hypoventilation (awake, sea-level PaCO2  >6.0 kPa (>45 mmHg)) among patients with BMI ≥30 kg⋅m−2 in the absence of other causes of  hypoventilation. 90% of OHS patients have concomitant OSA (AHI ≥5 events per h) and upper  airway obstruction is the main pathophysiological component of the disease. The initial therapy  for mild OHS is CPAP therapy but patients with marked hypercapnia, as in this case, will need  nocturnal assisted ventilation (bilevel positive airway pressure (PAP)). Nocturnal oxygen use at  2 L⋅min−1 alone is an inadequate therapy for OHS, as it does not correct underlying hypoventilation and may worsen hypercapnia through suppression of the hypoxic ventilatory drive. A similar  effect may occur with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and there is no evidence to support the  use of this in OHS. However, if desaturations
    persist despite bilevel PAP, supplemental oxygen  should be added to the bilevel PAP during sleep to reach 90% saturation without frequent periods of >95% (to avoid hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia). Acetazolamide will stimulate the drive  to breathe but will not correct the upper airway obstruction. Adaptive servoventilation is not  approved for OHS. Ultimately, weight loss is the definitive treatment.

  input: A 65-year-old male is admitted to the hospital because of high fever and dyspnoea associated with  purulent sputum. Physical examination reveals dullness on percussion on the right lower chest and  rales on auscultation. Chest radiography shows a pneumonic infiltrate in the right upper lobe and a  small pleural effusion. Thoracentesis is performed. Which of the following results of the pleural fluid analysis indicates the need for chest-tube  drainage?
  options:
  - Serosanguineous appearance
  - pH <7.2
  - Glucose <60 mmol⋅L−1
  - Negative Gram stain
  - Lactate dehydrogenase >200 U⋅L−1
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Infection of the pleural space accompanying pneumonia leads to invasion of inflammatory cells  (neutrophils) associated with acidosis, low glucose levels and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  levels. Parapneumonic effusions that require tube drainage are termed complicated parapneumonic effusions. The most accurate predictor of the need for chest tube drainage is a pH <7.2. A  low glucose (<3.4 mmol⋅L−1) and high LDH level (>1000 U⋅L−1) do not improve diagnostic accuracy but may be used to assess the need for chest tube drainage if the pH cannot be measured.  The glucose concentration is usually <3.4 mmol⋅L−1 if the pH is <7.2. Identification of microorganisms in the Gram stain indicates empyema requiring tube drainage. A serosanguineous  appearance, a negative Gram stain, normal glucose and an only slightly elevated LDH are nonspecific and not helpful in assessing the need for tube drainage.

  input: A 69-year-old, lifelong heavy smoker is assessed for exertional dyspnoea. He has a past history of  hypertension and 3 years ago, he had a cerebrovascular accident with good functional recovery. Spirometry shows FEV1 1.2 L, FVC 2.4 L, FEV1/FVC 50%, TLCO 50% predicted and oxygen saturation  on room air 92%. After walking 310 m in 6 min, the patient is profoundly breathless, with Borg  dyspnoea score 8 (out of 10) and oxygen saturation on room air 88%. 15 min after the exercise,  repeat spirometry shows FEV1 1.0 L, FVC 2.0 L and FEV1/FVC 50%. What is the least likely cause of the breathlessness?
  options:
  - Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction
  - Diffusion impairment
  - Dynamic hyperinflation
  - Occult ischaemic heart disease
  - Deconditioning
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: 'Both lung function and peripheral muscle force are important determinants of exercise capacity  in COPD. The limitation to exercise in COPD is usually multifactorial in origin, partly reflecting  some or all of: • The consequences of airflow obstruction • Dynamic hyperinflation • Defective gas exchange • Peripheral muscle dysfunction. The limitations in exercise capacity are worsened by the effects of physical deconditioning and  may be further worsened by the presence of comorbid conditions such as arthritis or cardiac  disease. Hence, in this patient, all of the answer options except exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, which largely occurs in asthma and is not suggested by the spirometry and reduced  oxygen saturation after exercise, may explain this patient’s exercise limitation.'

  input: A 49-year-old secretary is referred for dyspnoea on exertion and a chronic cough. She has been  extensively examined for a persistent fever, but no infectious cause could be identified. She also  complains of painful swelling of her wrists and her ankles; her thighs and her upper arms ache  when she exercises. Her fingers suddenly hurt and turn white when she plays the accordion. She  also has markedly thickened skin over her knuckles. Pulmonary function testing reveals an FVC of  70% predicted and FEV1 of 75% pred; diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide is 45%  pred. On HRCT, small pulmonary nodules and linear and ground-glass opacities of both lungs are  found. Laboratory results are remarkable for elevated lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and  anti-Jo-1 antibody levels. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?
  options:
  - Antisynthetase syndrome
  - Paraneoplastic disease
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Systemic sclerosis
  - Sarcoidosis
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: The patient suffers from antisynthetase syndrome with the characteristic combination of  inflammatory myositis, unexplained persistent fever, arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon and interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease commonly presents as nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. The skin over the knuckles is thickened as if the patient was performing hard physical  work with her hands (Gottron’s sign or mechanic’s hands). Antisynthetase antibodies (i.e. antiJo-1) directed against several aminoacyl transfer RNA sythetases are elevated. Paraneoplastic dermatomyositis could present similarly, but would lack arthritis and anti-Jo-1  would not be elevated. Rheumatoid arthritis would neither cause Raynaud’s phenomenon nor  mechanic’s hands. Systemic sclerosis would not present with mechanic’s hands and anti-Scl70,  rather than anti-Jo-1, would be elevated. Sarcoidosis would not present with Raynaud phenomenon, mechanic’s hands or anti-Jo-1 either.

  input: A 49-year-old woman is referred for exercise testing to evaluate her dyspnoea. She stops the test  because of dyspnoea at a maximal workload of 100 W (60% predicted) with a maximal oxygen  uptake of 23 mL⋅kg−1⋅min−1 (58% predicted). Her heart rate reserve is 25 beats per min and her  breathing reserve is 10%. Her inspiratory capacity before and at the end of the test is 1200 and  900 mL, respectively. What is the most likely cause of her dyspnoea?
  options:
  - Deconditioning
  - Congestive heart failure
  - Hyperventilation
  - with a maximal oxygen  uptake of 23 mL⋅kg−1⋅min−1 (58% predicted). Her heart rate reserve is 25 beats per min and her  breathing reserve is 10%. Her inspiratory capacity before and at the end of the test is 1200 and  900 mL, respectively. What is the most likely cause of her dyspnoea?
  - Neuromuscular disease
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: This patient’s exercise capacity is decreased because of ventilatory limitation, reflected by an  exhausted breathing reserve; a breathing reserve <15% indicates ventilatory limitation. Her  inspiratory capacity decreased by 300 mL during exercise due to dynamic hyperinflation, which  typically occurs in obstructive airway disease. If her exercise capacity were limited by heart failure or deconditioning, the heart rate reserve  would be exhausted. With hyperventilation and with neuromuscular disease, the inspiratory  capacity, which is the difference between functional residual capacity and TLC, would not  decrease during exercise.

  input: 'A 33-year-old female in the second trimester of pregnancy presents to the emergency room due to  progressive dyspnoea for the past 48 h. She has a history of asthma. Her BMI is 40.5 kg ⋅ m−2, heart  rate is 130 beats per min and blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Breath sounds are diminished on  both lung bases. The left calf is swollen. Her chest radiography is normal. Arterial blood gas analysis  shows: PaO2 7.315 kPa (55 mmHg), PaCO2 3.99 kPa (30 mmHg) and pH 7.48 in room air. Which of the following is the next diagnostic procedure?'
  options:
  - D-dimer.
  - CT pulmonary angiography.
  - Compression ultrasonography of the legs.
  - Lung perfusion scintigraphy.
  - Echocardiography.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: 'D-dimers are typically elevated during pregnancy and, therefore, are not useful in this setting.  Chest CT angiography and lung perfusion scintigraphy are both associated with ionising   radiation and, therefore, should be used with caution in pregnancy. In the described case with  a high pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism (Wells score 10), American Thoracic Society  (ATS) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend compression ultrasound  for deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) as the first diagnostic procedure. If this is positive, pulmonary  embolism can be assumed and treated with heparin. Warfarin is teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy. In the absence of DVT symptoms or signs, the data are controversial: the  ATS guidelines suggest a chest radiograph as the first radiation-associated test. If this is normal,  ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy is recommended as the next step; if the radiograph is abnormal, chest CT angiography is suggested. The
    ESC suggests compression ultrasound in all cases  of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. If this is negative, either a perfusion lung scan  or chest CT angiography is recommended. Ventilation lung scan is not recommended because  of approximately doubled fetal exposure to radiation compared with chest CT angiography or  perfusion scan alone.'

  input: A 35-year-old male is admitted to hospital because of acute onset of fever (38°C), dry cough, severe  dyspnoea and mental confusion. Arterial blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg, heart rate is regular at  120 beats/min and respiratory rate is 36 breaths/min. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals a PaO2 of  8.65 kPa (65 mmHg), PaCO2 of 5.59 kPa (42 mmHg), bicarbonate concentration of 24.2 mmol⋅L−1 and  a pH of 7.42. Chest radiography and CT show diffuse, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Bronchoalveolar  lavage reveals 920 × 109 cells⋅L−1 with 35% eosinophils, 8% neutrophils and 57% macrophages.  A broad search for parasitic infestation is negative. Which of the following statements about this case is correct?
  options:
  - Blood eosinophilia is required to support the diagnosis.
  - The recommended treatment consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
  - Thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required to support the diagnosis.
  - Corticosteroids result in rapid resolution.
  - The prevalence of this condition is reduced in smokers.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The high eosinophil count in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid suggests the presence of a  form eosinophilic lung disease. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is usually accompanied by  dyspnoea, fever and hypoxia, and develops within <1 week. It responds well to corticosteroids.  The described case is consistent with this diagnosis and lung biopsy is not required. Chronic  eosinophilic pneumonia is subacute with progressive symptoms of breathlessness, night  sweats, weight loss, cough, fever and wheezing. The aetiology of AEP is unknown. It has been  shown that in the initial phase of AEP, blood eosinophilia is not present, in contrast to marked  eosinophilia (>25%) in the BAL fluid. Several drugs, including antibiotics, and chemical and  physical agents, may induce AEP. A few studies have suggested a relationship between smoking and AEP, particularly new-onset smoking. Other reasons for pulmonary eosinophilia include  helminth infections, coccidioidal infections, drugs
    (e.g. inhaled cocaine) and several toxins (particulate metals, aluminium silicate, solvents, etc.), medication (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, ampicillin, sulfonamides, etc.), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, allergic  bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome.

  input: 'In the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), cost-effectiveness of lung volume reduction  surgery (LVRS) in patients with severe pulmonary emphysema was compared with medical treatment. The results revealed a cost-effectiveness ratio of LVRS of US$53 000 per quality adjusted life  year (QALY) at 10 years of follow-up. These results suggest that:'
  options:
  - The estimated cost of LVRS is US$53 000 per patient.
  - The yearly estimated cost of LVRS is US$53 000 per patient.
  - LVRS costs more than medical treatment.
  - LVRS costs less than medical treatment.
  - The estimated cost of LVRS is US$5300 per patient.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Novel medical treatments are traditionally evaluated in terms of the effects on symptoms, quality of life, morbidity and mortality. In times of dramatic increases in healthcare costs and limited  financial resources, assessment of the costs of novel, potentially more effective treatments are  increasingly important and crucial for decisions on resource allocation. Health economists apply  a few basic concepts that a physician should know. Thus, the costs of a novel treatment are  analysed in relation to its effects and compared with a reference treatment. This may involve  extensive measurements, calculations and estimations. Effectiveness is often assessed by subjective outcomes such as quality of life measures. In order  to allow comparison among different diseases and treatments, generic instruments that are not  specific to a particular disease are preferred. For application in economic analyses, the utility  index is used. It is defined as the subjective preference of a
    patient for a given health state and  rated on a scale anchored at 0, corresponding to death, and 1, corresponding to perfect health.  By multiplying the utility index by the years spent in a particular health state, QALYs can be  computed. The difference in costs between a treatment of interest and a reference treatment  (or placebo) divided by the difference in QALY gained between the two treatments represents  the cost-effectiveness ratio. The longer a patient stays alive with good quality after an intervention, the greater the QALY gained by this intervention and the lower its cost-effectiveness ratio.  The value of the ratio is often not known from scientific studies but extrapolated to life time  based on observations over a limited study period. Importantly, the costs not only include direct  costs for healthcare but may involve significant indirect costs related to absence from work, for  example. In regard to LVRS, the NETT has shown that appropriately selected patients with
    severe pulmonary  emphysema benefit from surgery in terms of quality of life and survival. The cost- effectiveness  was calculated over the duration of the trial and extrapolated to 10 years of follow-up. A costeffectiveness ratio of US$53 000 per QALY at 10 years indicates that LVRS is more expensive  than medical treatment. Each additional year spent in perfect quality of life is estimated to cost  US$53 000.

  input: A 24-year-old nonsmoking woman was diagnosed with asthma 9 months ago, and has been on  500 μg beclomethasone and 9 μg formoterol, both twice daily, plus salbutamol as needed, since  then. She has been asymptomatic for the past 3 months. Her FEV1 is 3.8 L (97% predicted). Which one of the following should you advise her to do?
  options:
  - Continue the same treatment
  - Reduce beclomethasone dosage
  - Discontinue formoterol
  - Discontinue salbutamol
  - Discontinue medication
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The patient is on a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (1000 μg beclomethasone per day)  and has been asymptomatic for 3 months. According to the Global Initiative for Asthma, asthma  patients should have their dose adjusted to the lowest possible that assures control. High-dose  ICS carries a risk of long-term side-effects, so her ICS should be reduced to a medium dose.  Stepping down ICS doses by 25–50% at 3-month intervals is feasible and safe for most patients.  If the patient remains asymptomatic for the next 3 months, formoterol may be discontinued.  Salbutamol is prescribed as needed and should not be discontinued. Lastly, stepping down  should be performed in intervals and, therefore, discontinuation of medication in a patient on  high-dose treatment is contraindicated.

  input: A 36-year-old woman presents to your office after coughing up 5–10 mL bright red blood the   previous day. 3 days earlier she had noted the onset of a runny nose and frequent nonproductive cough.  She denies experiencing fever, chest pain or dyspnoea. She has no previous history of haemoptysis  but was hospitalised for pneumonia for 2 weeks at the age of 22 years. She has smoked half a pack  of cigarettes per day for 16 years. She appears healthy except for a frequent nonproductive cough.  The physical examination is normal, including vital signs, chest examination and cardiac examination. Laboratory studies show a haematocrit of 39%, leukocyte count of 8600 per μL and normal  differential white blood cell count. Her platelet count is 17 5 000 per μL, blood urea nitrogen is  14 mg·dL−1 (0.78 mmol·L−1) and serum creatinine is 0.8 mg·dL−1 (0.04 mmol·L−1). Urinalysis shows  no erythrocytes, 40–50 leukocytes per high-power field, few bacteria and no protein by dipstick. No  casts are
    seen. Chest radiography is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic step to perform next?
  options:
  - Flexible bronchoscopy
  - CT of the chest
  - Endoscopy of the upper airways
  - Serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody with cytoplasmic staining pattern and   antiglomerular basement membrane antibody
  - Repeat chest radiography at 3 and 6 months
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: This young woman’s hemoptysis must be investigated immediately. As the chest radiograph is  normal, a CT scan of the chest needs to be performed to localise the source and the eventual  cause of the bleeding. CT should be performed before bronchoscopy to better plan the latter,  invasive procedure. The haemoptysis in this patient is most likely caused by mucosal bronchial  bleeding secondary to an acute respiratory infection on top of a chronic bronchitis due to smoking. Endoscopy of the upper airways should only be performed after active bleeding of the lower  airways and the lung has been excluded because pulmonary haemorrhage is potentially more  harmful than bleeding of the upper airways. There are no characteristic findings of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, such as upper airway or renal involvement. Goodpasture syndrome with  antibodies against glomerular basal membrane is unlikely because there is no proteinuria.
- id: Q57
  input: Which of the following findings is/are consistent with acute pulmonary embolism occluding less  than 50% of the pulmonary vasculature?
  options:
  - A right pulmonary artery diameter of 35 mm on CT
  - A mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 50 mmHg
  - A right atrial pressure of 8 mmHg
  - A pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of 14 mmHg
  correct_answer:
  - C
  - D
  rationale: In acute pulmonary embolism, the diameter of the pulmonary artery is not enlarged. However,  a diameter of the pulmonary artery of >29 mm has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 89%  for a chronically elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. With a diameter of >33 mm, the specificity and sensitivity increase to 95%. Only with an obstruction of more than 50% will pulmonary hypertension (i.e. a mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg) develop. However, even  with the most severe pulmonary embolism, the unconditioned right ventricle will not be able  to achieve a pressure of >40 mmHg. Thus, an elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure of  50 mmHg is not consistent with acute pulmonary embolisms but might be a feature of chronic  thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). A slightly elevated right atrial pressure is  compatible with acute pulmonary embolism. Typically, there is no left heart failure in acute  pulmonary embolism and a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure of
    14 mmHg is compatible with this diagnosis.

  input: A 58-year-old taxi driver is referred for evaluation of excessive sleepiness. His wife reports that  he is a heavy snorer, has frequent breathing pauses during sleep and appears to be increasingly  depressed and without energy. Nocturnal pulse oximetry reveals repetitive oxygen desaturations  (dip rate >4%, 34 events per h). Which of the following treatments is most likely to improve his symptoms?
  options:
  - Nocturnal supplemental oxygen
  - Nocturnal CPAP
  - Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
  - Acetazolamide at bedtime
  - A tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Based on the typical clinical presentation consisting of excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring,  witnessed apnoeas and nocturnal pulse oximetry demonstrating an elevated oxygen desaturation  index of 34 events per h, this patient suffers from OSAS. The treatment of choice is nocturnal  CPAP via a nasal or oronasal mask. None of the other presented treatments has been shown to  be beneficial to OSAS patients. Supplemental oxygen does not prevent upper airway collapse,  the pathophysiological hallmark of OSAS. Very few randomised trials have evaluated upper  airway surgery as treatment for OSAS and their results were negative. Acetazolamide, a carbonic  anhydrase inhibitor that stimulates ventilation by inducing metabolic acidosis, has been found  to improve central sleep apnoea at high altitude but the drug is not an effective treatment for  OSAS. Tricyclic antidepressants may reduce rapid eye movement sleep and possibly snoring but  their effect on OSAS is not clinically relevant.

  input: Regarding diffusing TLCO, which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
  options:
  - Among routine pulmonary function tests, single-breath TLCO is the most sensitive method to  detect abnormalities in pulmonary gas exchange.
  - Broadening of the alveolar–capillary membrane is the most common cause of decreased TLCO.
  - Measured TLCO is significantly dependent on the available surface area for gas exchange.
  - Anaemia alone can cause a reduction in the measurement of TLCO, even in patients with normal  lungs.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: TLCO is a sensitive measure of the transfer of gas from the alveoli to red blood cells in lung capillaries. Loss of pulmonary capillaries and the subsequent shrinking of the gas exchange surface  is the most common cause of impaired TLCO while broadening of the alveolar–capillary barrier is  another, but rarer, cause of decreased diffusion. Anaemia reduces TLCO because fewer red blood  cells pass through the lung per unit time.

  input: A 37 year-old patient presents with adult-onset asthma. Due to increased production of brownish  sputum production, and perihilar and upper lobe opacities on a conventional chest radiograph, a  CT scan is performed showing central bilateral bronchiectasis and infiltrates. Bronchoscopy shows  mucus plugs in the central airways. Which of the following statements concerning a suspected underlying disorder is correct?
  options:
  - Fungal invasion of the bronchial mucosa is typically found in bronchoscopic biopsy specimens.
  - Total serum IgE and blood eosinophils are typically normal.
  - Patients with cystic fibrosis are more often affected than healthy persons.
  - Immunosuppressive therapy should be started with a combined regimen of glucocorticoids  and cyclophosphamide or a monoclonal antibody against CD20 receptor.
  - Antifungal treatment has no role in the therapy.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: The patient has allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a hypersensitivity reaction to  Aspergillus spp. (generally A. fumigatus) occurring almost exclusively in patients with asthma or  cystic fibrosis. The immune response to Aspergillus antigens causes airway obstruction and, if  untreated, bronchiectasis, and ultimately fibrotic, bullous or cavitary lung lesions. Productive  cough is a typical symptom. Some patients present with fever and weight loss. Diagnosis can  be suspected based on history and thoracic imaging, and is confirmed by a positive skin test  against Aspergillus antigen, and measurement of IgE and A. fumigatus-specific antibodies.  Treatment usually starts with systemic corticosteroids. In refractory cases, itraconazole may be  added. Apart from antifungal action, itraconazole may also act by an anti-inflammatory effect  and interferes with the hepatic metabolism of methylprednisolone augmenting its effect (this  does not apply to prednisolone, which
    is most often used). Antimetabolites and anti-CD20  receptor monoclonal antibodies are used in combination with glucocorticoids in the treatment  of vasculitis but not in ABPA.

  input: Which one of the following statements is correct regarding long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids  in the treatment of moderate to severe COPD?
  options:
  - It reduces mortality.
  - It reduces the frequency of exacerbations.
  - It reduces the rate of decline of FEV1.
  - It reduces the incidence of pneumonia.
  - It has no significant adverse side-effects.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The Cochrane review by Yang et al. (2012) included 55 studies with 16 154 participants. It  showed that the long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduced the mean rate of exacerbations by more than 0.25 exacerbations per patient per year. Long-term use of ICS had no  statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients and did not consistently reduce the  rate of FEV1 decline in COPD. ICS increased the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis, hoarseness  and the incidence rate of pneumonia. Additionally, the review also showed that ICS slowed the  rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire.

  input: A 63-year-old healthy woman, who has never smoked, has been visiting her family, including  three grandchildren. The children have been suffering from a febrile illness, passing it between  one another, and two of them have had severe earaches. After being at their home for 2 weeks,  the patient experiences a nonproductive cough, fever and weakness. Her chest radiograph shows  a right mid-lung infiltrate and a small pleural effusion. The white blood count of her pleural fluid is  560 cells per mm3. The cold agglutinin titre of her acute serum is 1:16. She responds to treatment  with erythromycin. What could be done to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonia?
  options:
  - Obtain a second cold agglutinin titre 3–6 weeks later; if the titre fails to show at least a four-fold  rise, this has to be considered strong evidence against the diagnosis.
  - Obtain acute and convalescent titres of complement-fixing antibody against Mycoplasma pneumoniae; if there is at least a four-fold increase in titre, this is strong evidence confirming the  diagnosis.
  - Wait for results of throat washings cultured for M. pneumoniae; if the cultures are negative, this  is strong evidence against the diagnosis.
  - Study the serum complement-fixing antibody against Chlamydophila pneumoniae (TWAR)  because a titre of 1:16 or greater would strongly favour a diagnosis of chlamydial pneumonia.
  - Avoid ordering additional tests because effusions are rare in Mycoplasma pneumonia and this  makes the diagnosis most unlikely.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Mycoplasma pneumoniae; if there is at least a four-fold increase in titre, this is  strong evidence confirming the diagnosis. Mycoplasma pneumonia can present with cough and chest pain, and be accompanied by wheezing. Nonrespiratory symptoms, such as arthralgia and headache, might also suggest Mycoplasma  infection. The complement fixation test (CFT) is still regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis  of M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Elevated CFT titres are detected no earlier than 10–14 days after  the onset of mycoplasma infection. Titration of antibodies in acute- and convalescent-phase  serum specimens is usually performed. A four-fold increase in titre can confirm the diagnosis.  If cold agglutinins are present in a patient with community-acquired pneumonia, the higher  the cold agglutinin titre (>1:64), the more likely the cold agglutinins are due to M. pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae infections may also be diagnosed by cultivation of the organism on complex  agar medium. Because
    of the slow growth of the organism, partly reflecting fastidious nutrient  requirements, culture techniques are expensive and slow.

  input: A 52-year-old patient with severe late-onset intrinsic asthma and a history of sinusitis stopped  taking systemic corticosteroids 4 weeks ago. Now, he is suffering from fever, malaise and moderate weight loss. Due to severe chest pain that does not allow the patient to lie on his left side, he  is referred to the intensive care unit. On auscultation, a pericardial friction rub is audible. On his  skin, several new-onset haemorrhagic lesions are visible. His creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB are  elevated. Which laboratory test could best help to support the suspected diagnosis?
  options:
  - Blood eosinophil count
  - Skin prick test for Aspergillus sp.
  - Anti-basement membrane antibodies
  - Anti-synthetase antibodies (Jo-1)
  - Troponin T
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Peripheral blood eosinophils >10% are a hallmark of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. This multisystem disorder is characterised by asthma, blood eosinophilia, sinusitis and,  in some cases, mononeuritis multiplex, pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmia. Skin prick test for Aspergillus sp. would help in the diagnosis of allergic pulmonary aspergillosis,  another disease associated with asthma. Anti-basement membrane antibodies are elevated in  Goodpasture’s syndrome, which is associated with renal glomerular disease and pulmonary  alveolar haemorrhage. Anti-synthetase antibodies (Jo-1; anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA antibodies) are elevated in idiopathic anti-inflammatory diseases with arthritis, myopathy and  Raynaud’s syndrome, which can be associated with interstitial lung disease. Cardiac troponin  T is expected to be elevated in this patient with probable perimyocarditis, as suggested by an  elevated CK-MB; however, elevated troponin would not help to secure the
    diagnosis, as the suspected cardiac involvement is just one manifestation of the vasculitic disease.

  input: Which of the following treatments has/have been shown to reduce mortality among selected  patients with COPD in prospective randomised studies?
  options:
  - Long-term oxygen therapy
  - Pulmonary rehabilitation
  - A combination of an inhaled long-acting β-adrenergic agent and a corticosteroid
  - Lung volume reduction surgery
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - D
  rationale: The Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial and the UK Medical Research Council study, carried out  about 30 years ago, showed a significantly improved survival with continuous (>16 h per day)  oxygen supplementation in COPD patients who were hypoxaemic (PaO2 <7.3 kPa (<55 mmHg)  or 7.3–7.9 kPa (55–59 mmHg) with signs of right heart failure) in a stable phase of their disease.  A meta-analysis of the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients did not show a significant effect on survival of pulmonary rehabilitation. In the large randomised controlled Towards a  Revolution in COPD Health trial, where COPD patients were treated with a combination of salmeterol with fluticasone, salmeterol alone or fluticasone alone, no significant improved survival was  observed between these different treatment groups. Severe COPD patients with a heterogenous,  predominantly upper lobe emphysema, who did not improve after a period of pulmonary rehabilitation, had an improved survival after lung
    volume reduction surgery.

  input: A 35-year-old Caucasian male from South Africa, currently a resident of London, UK, presents to the  emergency room with productive cough and low-grade fever of approximately 6 weeks’ duration.  Six months ago, during a stay in South Africa, he had received treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin,  pyrazinamide and ethambutol for smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. The treatment had led  to rapid clinical improvement and he therefore stopped it upon return to London, after a dur ation  of 8 weeks. Clinical examination at admission reveals a BMI of 18 kg⋅m−2 and a temperature of 37.8°C but no  other abnormal findings. Chest radiography shows bilateral upper lobe infiltrates with a cavitary  lesion in the right upper lobe. The sputum contains acid-fast bacilli. A HIV test is negative. Results  of rapid molecular-based drug susceptibility tests are pending. Which of the following should be recommended for this patient?
  options:
  - Initiate regimen with 2HRZES/1HRZE/5HRE
  - Await results of molecular susceptibility testing
  - Complete treatment with 4HR
  - Start prolonged treatment with 2HRZE/6HE
  - 'Restart standard regimen with 2HRZE/4HR H: isoniazid; R: rifampicin; Z: pyrazinamide; E: ethambutol; S: streptomycin. Numbers before the  letters denote the duration of treatment in months.'
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: This patient presents with active TB after default interruption of treatment. Previous treatment  is a strong determinant of drug resistance and multidrug resistance (MDR). A global survey has  revealed that 15% of previously treated patients had MDR, compared with 3% of new cases. Therefore, particular precautions should be taken to avoid inappropriate treatment and thereby  promote and spread MDR. Prompt MDR identification enables the physician to specifically  select an appropriate combination of drugs. This enhances the chance of cure and contributes  to the prevention of spread of resistant strains. Using rapid molecular-based tests, MDR can be  confirmed or excluded within 1–2 days. Such tests are available in many European countries (as  in the described case) and the results should be used to guide treatment. If rapid drug susceptibility tests are not available, empirical treatment should be started based  on the likelihood of MDR-TB. This likelihood is considered high
    in patients with treatment  failure, who should receive empirical treatment for MDR-TB. Conversely, in patients returning with a relapse or after defaulting, the likelihood of MDR is lower (in countries with a low  MDR prevalence) and a retreatment regimen containing first-line drugs is acceptable, i.e.  2HRZES/1HRZE/5HRE is the recommended empirical retreatment in this setting. If the results  of susceptibility testing become available, treatment should be adapted accordingly. A treatment failure, a second or subsequent relapse or default of a previous treatment, a high local  rate of MDR and co-existent HIV infection are important criteria for selection of the retreatment  regimen.

  input: A 33-year-old man presents with minor haemoptysis, fatigue, weight loss and recurrent nasal bleeding. The chest radiograph discloses multiple dense infiltrates, some with cavitation, and the serum   cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA) test is positive with elevated anti-proteinase  3 (PR3) IgG. Which of the following initial treatments is most appropriate for the suspected disease?
  options:
  - Infliximab
  - Methotrexate
  - Azathioprine and prednisone
  - Cyclophosphamide and prednisone
  - Mycophenolate and prednisone
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: This is a case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. While glucocorticoid therapy alone extends  the 5-month mean survival of untreated cANCA-related vasculitis by only a few months, the  addition of immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide) to glucocorticoids is highly beneficial. Only localised or early systemic disease without the threat of vital organ involvement may  be treated with methotrexate and glucocorticoids, based on the dosing regimen used in the  NORAM (Nonrenal Wegener’s Granulomatosis Treated Alternatively with Methotrexate) study,  as this appears as effective as cyclophosphamide and avoids the toxicity of the latter. Tumour  necrosis factor inhibition with infliximab may have a role in refractory disease but not in routine  induction regimens.

  input: A 45-year-old male complains of dyspnoea on minimal exertion, orthopnoea and near fainting. In  the past few years, the patient has reportedly suffered from several episodes of haematemesis and  an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy had shown that this was due to oesophageal varices. On physical examination, he is pale, his blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg, heart rate is 74 beats per min  and regular, and SpO2 in room air is 94%. There is a split second heart sound, pulmonary auscultation is normal, abdominal examination suggests ascites and he has bilateral lower limb oedema.  Echocardiography reveals an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 45 mmHg and a left  ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Hepatopulmonary syndrome
  - Portopulmonary hypertension
  - Recurrent pulmonary embolism
  - Left ventricular failure
  - Systemic sclerosis
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Portopulmonary hypertension is defined as the coexistence of portal hypertension and pulmonary hypertension after exclusion of connective tissue disease, HIV, drug- and toxin-related pulmonary hypertension, or congenital heart disease. Pulmonary hypertension is defined according  to right heart catheterisation by a mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg at rest. A wedge  pressure of ≤15 mmHg excludes pulmonary hypertension due to left ventricular failure. Portal  venous pressure is usually 5–10 mmHg. Hepatopulmonary syndrome refers to the triad of  hepatic disease, impaired oxygenation and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. It typically manifests with platypnoea and orthodeoxia. Pulmonary embolism and systemic sclerosis do not lead  to portal hypertension and oesophageal varices. Portal hypertension is typically caused by liver  cirrhosis, recurrent infection of portal veins, HIV and some toxic substances.
- id: Q74
  input: A 53-year-old obese male (BMI 30.1 kg⋅m−2) is diagnosed with OSA with an AHI of 45 events per h  and an oxygen desaturation index of 40 events per h. He is given auto-adjusting nasal CPAP therapy  with an allowed pressure range of 5–15 cmH2O. On the first night of adaptation, his AHI went down  to 6 events per h and his ODI was 4 events per h. 3 days later, the patient reported that his sleepiness had already improved significantly. 1 month later, the patient returned to the sleep laboratory  and complained of recurring daytime sleepiness. Ambulatory pulse oximetry showed an oxygen  desaturation index of 34 events per h. Data downloaded from the CPAP machine suggested an  adequate compliance by the patient as the machine was used for 5.48 h per night on average. The  applied pressure ranged from 5 to 13.5 cmH2O and the 90th pressure percentile was 12 cmH2O. Which one of the following steps is the least promising in this situation?
  options:
  - Switch to bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation.
  - Switch to constant CPAP of 12 cmH2O.
  - Perform uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.
  - Switch to adaptive servoventilation.
  - Switch to mandibular advancement device.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Perform uvulopalatopharyngoplasty CPAP is usually effective in patients with OSAS. Optimal treatment of patients with predominantly mixed apnoeas, central sleep apnoea syndrome/Cheyne–Stokes respiration (CSA/CSR)  or complex sleep apnoea is less clear, but includes other positive pressure ventilation modalities. This patient most probably has complex sleep apnoea, i.e. central apnoeas emerging after  initial successful CPAP therapy. The clinical relevance of complex sleep apnoea is still a matter  of debate, as studies suggest that complex sleep apnoeas disappear during prolonged CPAP  therapy. If not, persistent residual central sleep apnoeas may disturb sleep quality and interfere with compliance, ultimately leading to CPAP intolerance. In this setting, bilevel positive  airway pressure ventilation in the spontaneous-timed mode and adaptive servoventilation may  prove beneficial. A mandibular advancement device (MAD) would not be expected to prevent  central apnoeic events
    but MADs have been shown to be an effective treatment for OSAS. No  randomised studies demonstrating the effectiveness of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in OSAS or  CSA/CSR have been performed.

  input: A 65-year-old male presents to you with increasing cough and breathlessness for the past 2 months,  weight loss of 7 kg over the same period, two episodes of haemoptysis and increasing fatigue. He is  a smoker of 20 cigarettes per day for 40 years. Chest radiography shows a left upper lobe mass  with mediastinal widening. Diagnostic work-up shows adenocarcinoma stage IV with cN2 disease  and adrenal metastasis. The diagnosis was based on cytology and epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status are negative. The patient’s status is good and no  comorbidities are present. Which one of the following is the appropriate treatment strategy for this patient?
  options:
  - Concurrent chemoradiation (platinum/etoposide and thoracic radiotherapy)
  - Chemotherapy with gemcitabine
  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (platinum/gemcitabine) followed by surgery
  - Chemotherapy with platinum/pemetrexed
  - followed by surgery
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80–85% of all lung cancer cases. The major  histopathological subtypes are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Decisions on the treatment strategy should take into account disease, histology, age,  performance status, comorbidities and patient preferences. Surgery remains the cornerstone  of early-stage (I, II and IIIA) NSCLC treatment, but only in stage I is 5-year survival >50%. There  is much room for improvement with systemic adjuvant or neoadjuvant approaches in stages II  and III. In patients with stage IIIB or stage IIIA–N2 subset, concomitant chemoradiotherapy at  systemic doses results in superior outcome to sequential chemoradiotherapy and is considered  the present standard of care. In patients with advanced (stage IV) NSCLC and good performance  status, two-drug platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated because of modest gains in survival and improved symptom control and quality of life.
    Pemetrexed is preferred to gemcitabine  in patients with nonsquamous histology according to a survival benefit demonstrated in clinical  trials. First-line treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib or gefitinib) is an option but  only in patients with tumours harbouring an activating EGFR mutation in exon 19 and/or 21.  Finally, single-agent chemotherapy is an alternative option, but only in elderly patients or in  patients with poor performance status.

  input: What is/are the characteristic(s) common to both nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis and  asthma?
  options:
  - Airway hyperresponsiveness
  - Good response to corticosteroids
  - Cough
  - Good response to bronchodilators
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Asthma is characterised by eosinophilic airway inflammation that responds well to steroid treatment. Asthma symptoms include dry cough, breathlessness and wheeze. Bronchoconstriction  occurs episodically during the disease and can be resolved spontaneously or in response to  bronchodilators. Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis shares the features of steroid responsiveness and chronic  eosinophilic inflammation of the airways causing cough, but it is distinctly different from  asthma regarding its lack of airway hyperresponsiveness and bronchoconstriction. This difference is used to discriminate between the two diseases.

  input: A 36-year-old immunocompetent male is admitted to the hospital with symptoms of recurrent  fever, cough, and anorexia and weight loss. Admission baseline investigations show normal renal  and liver function tests. A chest radiograph shows patchy infiltrates and cavitations in the right  and left upper lobe. Microbiological and molecular tests in sputum are positive for Mycobacterium  tuberculosis. Initial molecular drug resistance testing of mutations associated with rifampicin and  isoniazid resistance were negative. Which one of the following is the recommended treatment for this patient?
  options:
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and  rifampicin for 4 months
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 6 months
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin and pyrazinamide for 2 months, followed by  rifampicin and isoniazid for 7 months
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol for 6 months
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for 2 months, followed by rifampicin,   isoniazid and ethambutol for 4 months
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by M. tuberculosis. The World Health Organization  (WHO) estimates that 9.27 million new cases of TB occurred in 2007 and of them 44% were  infectious (new pulmonary sputum smear-positive cases). Sputum smear microscopy is still the  most widely used technique for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. Drug susceptibility testing using  molecular techniques can enhance TB diagnosis and help physicians to choose the appropriate  treatment. Due to their higher bacillary burden, individuals with active, smear-positive TB are the  main source of TB transmission in the community. The highest priority in TB control programmes  is the rapid identification of these cases and effective treatment. The WHO and CDC recommends that for patients in whom TB is proved or strongly suspected, treatment should be initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the initial 2 months. A repeat  smear and culture should be performed after
    2 months of treatment have been completed. If  cavities were seen on the initial chest radiograph or the acid-fast smear is positive at completion  of 2 months of treatment, the continuation phase of treatment should consist of isoniazid and  rifampicin daily or twice weekly for 4 months to complete a total of 6 months of treatment. If  cavitation was present on the initial chest radiograph and the culture at the time of completion of  2 months of therapy is positive, the continuation phase should be lengthened to 7 months (total  of 9 months of treatment). Although clinical trials have shown that the efficacy of streptomycin  is approximately equal to that of ethambutol in the initial phase of treatment, the increasing frequency of resistance to streptomycin globally has made the drug less useful. Thus, streptomycin  is not recommended as being interchangeable with ethambutol.

  input: In a patient with left ventricular failure, of which of the following phenomena during sleep is a low  waking PaCO2 (<4.7 kPa (<35 mmHg)) predictive?
  options:
  - Reduced sympathetic activity
  - Central sleep apnoea
  - Obstructive sleep apnoea–hypopnoea
  - Progressive hypocapnia during the night
  - Prolonged periods (>5 min) of arterial desaturation
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Left ventricular failure is associated with increased sympathetic activity and a low PaCO2 value is  predictive of central sleep apnoea rather than obstructive sleep apnoea–hypopnoea. PaCO2 may  fall below the apnoeic threshold during sleep but will rise again during the resultant apnoea  so that progressive hypocapnia does not occur. Prolonged periods of arterial desaturation are  not usually seen in central sleep apnoea because recurrent arousals return SaO2 to near-waking  levels, but are more typical of nocturnal hypoventilation.

  input: A 72-year-old patient with very severe COPD has been on long-term home oxygen therapy for  5 years. He suffers from recurrent exacerbations, which can usually be managed on an outpatient  basis. Recently he was admitted to the hospital due to respiratory failure. Which of the following statements is false?
  options:
  - Patients with very severe COPD should not be put on invasive ventilation because the probability that they can be extubated and discharged from hospital is low.
  - The decision to admit a patient with advanced COPD to the intensive care unit (ICU) should be  based more on the patient’s quality of life and his will to live than on the severity of the disease.
  - Patients with respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation should primarily be treated with NIV.
  - Patients suffering from very severe COPD who have been ventilated in an ICU due to respiratory  failure have a lower 5-year survival rate compared with patients with the same disease severity  who have not undergone mechanical ventilation during an exacerbation.
  - Recurrent exacerbations in patients who have been previously treated in an ICU are often due  to Gram-negative bronchial infections.
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Exacerbation of very severe COPD is a life-threatening condition. It may lead to acute respiratory failure superimposed on pre-existing chronic respiratory failure. The first-line treatment of  these patients is ventilatory support. If tolerated, NIV is the preferred mode; however, in some  patients, invasive ventilation cannot be avoided without risking the life of the patient. In very  severe COPD, the decision to start mechanical ventilation is mainly based on the advanced  directives, learning the patient’s wishes, assessing his/her quality of life and consulting family  members. Those patients who require mechanical ventilation due to COPD exacerbation have  lower 5-year life expectancy than patients who do not need ventilation. Mechanical ventilation  for acute respiratory failure in patients with COPD is associated with high rates of ICU mortality  (37–64% percent) but, nevertheless, this treatment is not futile.

  input: A 24-year-old medical student is consulting you before departing to Africa where he plans to climb  Mt Kilimanjaro (5895 m). Apart from seasonal allergic rhinitis, his medical history is unremarkable  and he is physically very fit. He asks for your advice regarding prevention of altitude-related illness.  You recommend a gradual ascent not exceeding 300–500 m every 24 h above 2500 m, avoidance  of physical overexertion and a low sleeping altitude if feasible. The student asks you to prescribe a  drug for prevention of acute mountain sickness. Which one of the following is the most appropriate?
  options:
  - Acetazolamide
  - Furosemide
  - Nifedipine
  - Sildenafil
  - Theophylline
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Altitude-related illnesses can be divided into acute and chronic forms. Chronic mountain sickness occurs in long-term residents at altitudes >3000 m. Acute forms include acute mountain  sickness (AMS), high-altitude cerebral oedema and high-altitude pulmonary oedema. AMS is  quite common in newcomers at altitudes >3000 m. About 60% of climbers reaching the top  of Mt Kilimanjaro suffer from AMS. Symptoms start within 6–12 h after arrival at altitude and  comprise headaches, fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and insomnia. Severe headaches resistant to nonsteroidal antirheumatics, ataxia and progressively altered consciousness  in a subject suffering from AMS are signs of impeding high-altitude cerebral oedema, a lifethreatening condition. High-altitude pulmonary oedema is much less common than AMS. It  occurs in susceptible subjects at altitudes >3000 m within a few hours to 3 days. Affected  subjects suffer from excessive dyspnoea, cough with our without sputum production,
    severe  cyanosis and, sometimes, elevated body temperature. Acute altitude-related illnesses may be  prevented by a gradual ascent not exceeding 300–600 m every 24 h above 2500 m allowing  enough time for acclimatisation, avoidance of extreme physical exertion, a low sleeping altitude  and drugs. Pharmacological prevention of AMS may be performed by acetazolamide (2 times  125 to 250 mg per day) or dexamethasone (2 times 4 mg per day), starting 24 h before ascent.  Furosemide does not prevent altitude-related illness and should not be taken at altitude to  avoid dehydration. Nifedipine and sildenafil reduce pulmonary artery pressure at high altitude  and may be used to prevent high-altitude pulmonary oedema. They have no role in prevention  or treatment of AMS. Theophylline reduces high-altitude periodic breathing but is not recommended for prevention of AMS.

  input: Which one of the following statements regarding post-operative outcome and prognosis in nonsmall  cell lung cancer is incorrect?
  options:
  - Outcome of surgery depends on the procedure volume of a hospital.
  - Lobectomy should be preferred over pneumonectomy if complete resection is possible with  lobectomy.
  - Segmentectomy may be an acceptable alternative to lobectomy in high-risk patients with  tumours <2 cm in diameter.
  - Formal lymph node dissection increases the post-operative complication rate compared with  selective sampling.
  - Tumour location in different lobes may be an indication for pneumonectomy or bilobectomy  with curative intent.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Principles of surgical treatment for nonsmall cell lung cancer include complete anatomic resection and complete lymph node dissection. The best results are obtained by well-trained specialised thoracic surgeons working in high-volume units. Procedure volume not only affects early  outcome but even long-term survival. Basic principles issued by a working group of the French Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular  Surgery opt for a complete anatomic resection including precise hilar dissection, according to  the loco-regional extent of the tumour. Lobectomy is preferred over pneumonectomy whenever  it enables a complete resection. Lobectomy is not possible if the tumour extends across the  fissure, invades the main pulmonary artery or involves the bronchial tree proximal to the lobar  root. A tumour located in different lobes is an indication for pneumonectomy or a bilobectomy.  Lobectomy is preferred to pneumonectomy because of its substantially lower peri-operative  risk. Routinely,
    it is not recommended to resect less tissue than a pulmonary lobe; however,  recent evidence suggests a place for segmentectomy in high-risk patients with tumours <2 cm  and even wedge excisions in very small bronchoalveolar carcinoma presenting as ground-glass  opacities. Complete homolateral lymph node dissection is important for staging. Leaving unrecognised  lymph node metastases is a risk for local recurrence. Formal lymph node dissection does not  increase the post-operative complication rate compared with sampling.

  input: A 34-year-old man has pulmonary tuberculosis with the lung lesion confined to the left upper  lobe, where there is a 3-cm cavity with extensive interstitial infiltration. He has had haematuria  and pyuria for 4 weeks, and an intravenous pyelogram shows deformed collecting structures in the  upper pole of the left kidney. Sputum and urine cultures are positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  A serum test for HIV infection is negative. Which one of the following is the treatment regimen of choice for this patient?
  options:
  - Isoniazid and rifampicin daily for 9 months
  - Isoniazid and rifampicin daily for 12 months
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol daily for 9 months
  - Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol daily for 2 months, followed by rifampicin  and isoniazid daily for 4 months
  - Isoniazid and rifampicin daily, together with streptomycin five times weekly for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin daily for 10 more months
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The British Thoracic Society guideline on tuberculosis recommends a 6-month, four-drug initial  regimen (6 months of isoniazid and rifampicin, supplemented in the first 2 months with pyrazinamide and ethambutol) to treat active respiratory tuberculosis in adults not known to be HIV  positive, adults who are HIV positive and children. The reason for using four drugs in the initial  phase is that, in most cases, the resistance pattern will not be known. The addition of pyrazinamide in the initial phase (2 months) results in quicker sputum conversion and allows the reduction of the total treatment period from 9 to 6 months. The recommended regimen for renal tuberculosis is the same as for pulmonary tuberculosis.

  input: A 24-year-old female is visiting your outpatient clinic for regular follow-up of her asthma. You have  known this patient for 7 years because she has allergic asthma (allergies to house dust mites, grass  and tree pollen). During the pollen season, she has only minor complaints of intermittent allergic  rhinitis, for which she uses an antihistamine as needed. At the age of 17 years, she was admitted to  the hospital because of a severe asthma attack. Since then, she has been followed up regularly. Her  last check-up was 3 months ago. She was stable at that time. Therefore, you reduced her medication from budesonide/formoterol 200/6 μg twice a day to budesonide/formoterol 200/6 μg once  in the morning. Since then, she has remained completely asymptomatic both in the daytime and at  night. She plays tennis twice a week without any problems. She has used her terbutaline only twice  during the past 3 months because she felt so well. According to the Global Initiative for Asthma management
    strategy, what would be the most  appropriate next action?
  options:
  - Continue budesonide/formoterol 200/6 μg once a day for a total of 6 months, if the patient is  stable, then stop and prescribe terbutaline as needed.
  - Continue budesonide/formoterol 200/6 μg once a day and as reliever medication as needed,  and schedule a follow up visit in 1 month.
  - Stop the budesonide/formoterol, prescribe terbutaline as needed, schedule an appointment  in 1 month.
  - Switch to budesonide 200 μg once a day and terbutaline as needed, schedule a further appointment in 3 months.
  - Switch to monotherapy formoterol 6 μg once a day and as needed and schedule a follow up  visit in 1 month.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: According to the new 2015 Global Initiative for Asthma management strategy, the inhaled  corticosteroids (ICS)/long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) should be reduced to once daily low-dose  ICS/LABA (i.e. 200–400 μg once a day). Once good asthma control has been achieved and  maintained for 3 months, and lung function has reached a plateau, a further reduction in therapy  can be considered (discontinuation of the LABA and the change of the reliever medication to  a short-acting β2-agonist while keeping the ICS). Complete cessation of ICS in adults is not  advised as the risk of exacerbations is increased. In addition, low-dose budesonide/formoterol is  the recommended reliever medication for patients prescribed low-dose budesonide/formoterol.  Stopping the controller treatment in stable asthma is considered to be inappropriate.

  rationale: This is a young cystic fibrosis patient with rapid, progressive respiratory deterioration despite  excellent compliance. Both FEV1 ≤30% predicted and rapid progressive deterioration are criteria  for transplantation. There is no absolute contraindication for transplantation indicated in this  case. The depression does not interfere with compliance and could be treated. While a review showed improvements in exercise capacity, strength and quality of life after  exercise training, with some evidence of a slower decline in lung function, these effects are not  consistent across trials. Because of the FEV1 and its rapid decline, pulmonary rehabilitation is  not a sufficient approach. There is no indication of current pneumothorax and prophylactic pleurodesis would cause  his current status to deteriorate. The history of recent pneumothorax does not exclude  transplantation. While single-lung transplantation is advantageous to organ allocation, especially in COPD, it is  not an option
    in patients with cystic fibrosis, who tend to have chronic infections of their lungs. Hospice care and frequent follow-up are indicated if all therapeutic options are exhausted. In  this patient transplantation would be the treatment of choice.

  input: A 43-year-old male complains of sudden bilateral chest pain, aggravated by inspiration, and  accompanied by malaise and slight fever. Physical examination shows some tenderness on both  sides of the chest but normal breath sounds. His chest radiograph appears normal but ultrasound  reveals small bilateral pleural effusions. The patient reports that 1 week ago, one of his children was  admitted to the hospital with acute meningitis. Which of the following is the most likely microorganism causing his illness?
  options:
  - Varicella–zoster virus
  - Coxsackievirus B
  - Influenza virus
  - Epstein–Barr virus
  - Adenovirus
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: This patient’s history and the simultaneous diagnosis of meningitis in his child point to an infectious disease. Bilateral chest pain aggravated by breathing movements is typical of epidemic  pleurodynia (also known as Bornholm disease or epidemic myalgia), which is often caused by  coxsackievirus B infection. The pain is usually caused by involvement of the intercostal muscles.  The disease can be accompanied by headache, pleuritis, meningitis and myocarditis. Analgesics,  narcotics and heating pads are the mainstays of therapy. Patients generally recover completely  within 1 week.
- id: Q87
  input: A 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension is hospitalised for colon cancer surgery. He  undergoes a successful subtotal colectomy and ileocolic anastomosis, without any signs of complication. His immediate post-operative state is good, but on post-operative day 4 he develops  sudden-onset shortness of breath and also has two episodes of haemoptysis. His blood pressure  is 130/70 mmHg; his pulse is regular, with a rate of 110 beats per min and his respiratory rate is  28 breaths per min. His temperature is normal and his SpO2 is 88% on room air, which improves  to 95% on 2 L per min of oxygen via nasal cannula. He has mildly decreased breath sounds at his  left lung base and a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. His abdomen is soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds. The patient does not have any oedema or tenderness in the  lower extremities. The laboratory analyses, including a complete blood cell count and basic metabolic panel, are normal. Arterial blood
    gas analysis on room air demonstrates a PaO2 of 7.28 kPa (56 mmHg), a PaCO2 of  3.99 kPa (30 mmHg), and a pH of 7.48, with an SpO2 of 90%. Chest radiography reveals left basilar  segmental atelectasis. The ECG shows tachycardia of 116 beats per min and a right bundle branch  block, which is a new finding for this patient. Which of the following is the next diagnostic test in order to confirm your diagnosis in this patient?
  options:
  - Plasma D-dimer levels
  - Perfusion lung scan, using the chest radiograph as a surrogate for the ventilation study
  - Multidetector CT pulmonary angiography
  - Lower limb compression venous ultrasonography (CUS)
  - Echocardiography
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: "In this case, a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) has to be made on the basis  of the patient’s medical history, physical findings and the ECG findings. PE is a relatively common condition that affects all age-groups and can potentially be lethal. Early  diagnosis is crucial, since immediate treatment is highly effective. Several clinical prediction rules  are available for the diagnosis of PE. Two of these, the Wells score and the Revised Geneva score,  have been widely used and validated in diagnostic studies. Whichever rule is used, the  prevalence of confirmed PE is approximately 10% in the low, 30% in the moderate and 70% in  the high probability category. This patient has a high clinical probability of PE according to both scores. \nAnother important issue is to assess the severity of the suspected PE. PE can be stratified into  several levels of risk of early death, based on the presence of risk markers. Immediate bedside  clinical assessment for the presence\
    \ or absence of clinical markers such as shock or hypotension allows stratification into high-risk and non-high-risk PE. This classification helps in the  choice of the optimal diagnostic strategy and initial management. This patient must be classified in the non-high-risk group of suspected PE. The diagnostic algorithm used to confirm or  exclude PE in this patient is presented in the figure. The 2008 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute  pulmonary embolism contain a diagnostic algorithm that can be used  to confirm or exclude PE in this patient. D-dimer measurement should be restricted to patients  with a low or intermediate clinical probability of PE. D-dimer should not be measured in patients  with a high clinical probability, because of its low negative predictive value in this population. It  is also less useful in hospitalised patients. \nVentilation/perfusion scintigraphy remains a valid option in the diagnostic algorithm of PE, \
    \ especially in patients with a contraindication to CT. But in many countries, only the perfusion  phase is performed in clinical practice and chest radiography is used as a surrogate for the ventilation study. This is not a preferred strategy when the perfusion scan is not normal, but may be  acceptable in patients with normal chest radiograph. CUS is used as an indirect method to diagnose PE. CUS can be used either as a backup procedure  to reduce the overall false-negative rate when using single-detector CT or it can be performed to  avoid CT when positive in patients with contraindications to CT. Echocardiography is particularly helpful in emergency management decisions, in patients with  suspected PE who are in a critical condition. In a patient with shock or hypotension, the absence  of echocardiographic signs of right ventricular overload or dysfunction practically excludes PE as  a cause of haemodynamic compromise. But systematic use of echocardiography for diagnosis  in haemodynamically\
    \ stable, normotensive patients is not recommended. CT angiography has become the main thoracic imaging test for investigating suspected PE.  Multidetector CT angiography (MDCT) is the first-line test in patients with a high clinical probability and the second-line test in patients with an elevated D-dimer level."

  input: Which of the following organisms is least likely to be part of the upper respiratory flora?
  options:
  - Streptococcus pneumoniae
  - Haemophilus influenzae
  - Escherichia coli
  - Legionella pneumophila
  - Bacteroides fragilis
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae or E. coli is due to microaspiration from the  oropharynx; thus, these bacteria may colonise the upper airways. B. fragilis is an anaerobic  bacterium that can be found in the upper airways and can result in lung infection in cases of  macroscopic aspiration. Legionella infection usually occurs through inhalation of contaminated  aerosols produced by water systems such as cooling towers, showers, hot water distribution  systems and taps. Consequently, Legionella is the least likely to colonise the upper airways.

  input: Which of the following statements about lung cancer treatment is/are correct?
  options:
  - Patients with small cell lung cancer with response to chemotherapy should be offered prophylactic cranial irradiation, unless they have a poor performance status or mental impairment.
  - In patients with advanced adenocarcinoma and haemoptysis, bevacizumab is recommended.
  - In patients with advanced squamous cell cancer and good performance status, a platinum  doublet therapy is recommended.
  - In stage IIIB nonsmall cell lung cancer in fit patients, preferred management is sequential  chemoradiotherapy.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  rationale: In patients with advanced squamous cell cancer and good performance status, a  platinum doublet therapy is recommended. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines suggest that in complete or partial response  to initial therapy of small cell lung cancer, prophylactic cranial irradiation is indicated, unless the  patient has poor performance status or impaired mental function. Bevacizumab blocks the vascular endothelial growth factor and is a recommended option for fit  patients (World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group stage 0–1) with nonsquamous cell carcinoma who are EGFR negative. Bevacizumab can cause severe haemorrhage  and should not be used in patients with central tumours and haemoptysis. Platinum-based therapy prolongs survival and improves symptom control and quality of life  in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. Two drug regimens are preferred. A third drug improves  response rate, but not survival. In squamous cell carcinoma, the gemcitabin/cisplatin
    combination shows superior efficacy compared with pemetrexed/cisplatin. Other options include platinum combinations with paclitaxel, docotaxel, vinorelbine, vinblastine and others. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been shown to produce better results and should be given  in fit patients. In unfit patients, a sequential approach should be chosen.

  input: 'A 67-year-old man with a previous history of myocardial infarction has dyspnoea after climbing one  set of stairs. He generally feels tired but does not fall asleep during the daytime (Epworth Sleepiness  Scale score 8). His BMI is 25 kg⋅m−2. He is on a diuretic, a statin and aspirin but no other medication. His left ventricular ejection fraction was 34% 2 years ago when the patient was admitted  with dyspnoea and pulmonary oedema. As his wife reports snoring, an ambulatory polygraphy is  performed. The results are: AHI 26 events per h, central AHI 17 events per h, lowest SpO2 83%, SpO2  <90% for 5% of time in bed. What is the most appropriate next step?'
  options:
  - Treat the patient with adaptive servoventilation if polysomnography confirms the results of the  polygraphy.
  - Treat the patient with CPAP if polysomnography confirms the results of the polygraphy.
  - Treat the patient with nasal oxygen if polysomnography confirms the results of the polygraphy.
  - Intensify the heart failure medication by using a β-blocker and/or angiotensin-converting  enzyme inhibitor.
  - At present, no therapy is needed, but in 1 year, the patient should come back to your clinic  again.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The patient has left ventricular failure with predominantly central sleep apnoea. The first step is  to optimise therapy for heart failure so a β-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should be added according to heart failure guidelines. Improvement in heart function may  improve sleep disordered breathing and the patient should be reassessed with a further sleep  study after the heart failure therapy has been optimised. If symptomatic central sleep apnoea  (CSA) persists, CPAP is not recommended and oxygen therapy has not demonstrated long-term  benefit. Adaptive servoventilation should not be recommended in a patient with CSA and a low  ejection fraction.

  input: A 27-year-old, previously healthy female presents with acute onset of dyspnoea and coughing  spells with blood-tinged sputum. Chest radiography shows extensive bilateral opacities. The patient  is hypoxic on room air (SpO2 84%). Sequential bronchoalveolar lavage reveals progressively bloodier  fluid return. You decide to look for an autoimmune disease. Which one of the following anti-body panels is least likely to confirm the diagnosis?
  options:
  - Anti-double stranded DNA antibody and anti-histone antibody
  - Anti-Scl antibody (scleroderma) and anti-phospholipid antibody
  - Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) and anti-cyclic citrullinated polypeptide antibody
  - Anti-nuclear antibody and ANCA
  - Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody and anti-smooth muscle protein antibody
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The patient suffers from a diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH). The most likely causes for  DAH in combination with an autoimmune disease include ANCA-associated diseases, such as  granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, Goodpasture syndrome (associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies) and systemic lupus erythematosus  (associated with anti-double stranded DNA antibody). Anti-Scl antibody and anti-phospholipid  antibody syndromes are very rare causes of DAH.
- id: Q94
  input: The introduction of inhaled long-acting β-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) in asthma therapy may have  adverse effects. In which of the following situations can the introduction of LABAs be expected to provide benefits  that outweigh the potential harmful effects?
  options:
  - Uncontrolled asthma according to GINA guidelines with 400 μg of daily budesonide
  - Asthma partially controlled with a leukotriene antagonist
  - In allergic asthma partially controlled with 1000 μg fluticasone-propionate daily
  - In difficult-to-treat asthma on systemic and inhaled corticosteroids
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: 'The safety of long-acting inhaled β-agonists (LABAs) has been a matter of debate for many  years due to concern regarding a paradoxical increase in serious asthma exacerbations in some  patients treated with these drugs. Shortly after approving salmeterol in 1994, the United States  Federal Drug Administration (FDA) began to receive reports of serious asthma exacerbations and  deaths in patients treated with the drug. To further evaluate these reports, the manufacturer  conducted the Salmeterol Multicentre Asthma Research Trial (SMART). In this study there were  eight more asthma-related deaths per 10 000 patients treated over the course of 28 weeks  among patients treated with salmeterol than among those given placebo. Based on these studies, the FDA issued the following guidelines on the use of LABAs: 1. LABAs should not be used for asthma in patients of all ages without concomitant use of an  asthma-controller medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. 2. Stop use of
    LABAs, if possible, once asthma control is achieved and maintain the use of an  asthma-controller medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. 3. Recommend against LABA use in patients whose asthma is adequately controlled with a  low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid. 4. Recommend that a fixed-dose combination product containing a LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid be used to ensure compliance with concomitant therapy in paediatric and adolescent patients who require the addition of a LABA to an inhaled corticosteroid.'

  input: A 56-year-old female suffers from obstructive apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. On polysomnography,  her AHI was 42 events per h and her oxygen desaturation index (≥4%) was 40 events per h. Due  to discomfort with this treatment, she refused the proposed CPAP therapy, although a sleep study  confirmed that her AHI was reduced to 5 events per h by CPAP. Attempts to convince the patient to  try nasal CPAP therapy again after adapting the mask and machine have been unsuccessful. Which one of the following alternative treatments is the most promising to relieve the symptoms  in this patient?
  options:
  - Mandibular advancement device
  - Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
  - High-flow nasal insufflation
  - Modafinil
  - Nasal surgery
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: 'Although the magnitude of improvement in the AHI is generally greater with CPAP, mandibular  advancement devices (MADs) are effective in the treatment of OSAS: 65% of patients achieve  a 50% reduction in AHI. Snoring, subjective sleepiness, neuropsychological function and blood  pressure have also been shown to decrease with MADs. Therefore, MADs are the alternative  treatment of choice for patients with OSAS who are unwilling or unable to comply with CPAP  therapy. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) performed by conventional techniques or with the use of  a laser has provided inconsistent and unpredictable results. UPPP was widely adopted in the  past as a single surgical treatment but, subsequently, a rate of failure of nearly 60% has been  demonstrated among unselected patients. High-flow insufflation of air into a nasal cannula has shown some benefit in reducing AHI.  However, only scarce data about the effects on important outcomes, such as daytime sleepiness  and blood
    pressure, are available. Modafinil has been shown to be effective as an adjunct to CPAP in patients with residual sleepiness despite CPAP treatment. However, modafinil has no use in treatment of sleep apnoea  per se. The main indication of the drug is the treatment of excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy  patients. Nasal obstruction promotes snoring and obstructive apnoea and interferes with successful  nasal CPAP therapy. However, nasal surgery alone is not an effective treatment for OSAS.'

  input: Large randomised controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate COPD have shown unambiguously that inhaled bronchodilators improve which of the following?
  options:
  - FEV1
  - Quality of life
  - Exacerbation rate
  - Mortality
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with β adrenergic agonists and tiotropium bromide  have shown a significant improvement in FEV1, quality of life (as evaluated by questionnaires)  and the rate of exacerbations (defined either by a change in medication or a hospitalisation).  Two large RCTs have failed to show a significant reduction in mortality in the intention-to-treat  analysis. However, the significance level of p=0.05 was missed only by a small fraction. One  large RCT in patients with chronic bronchitis and mild COPD showed a significant reduction of  mortality in the intention-to-treat population with smoking cessation (intensive cessation programme using nicotine replacement therapy). When considering common treatment options it  is useful to know on what grounds (e.g. study end-points) recommendations are made. It is also  important to consider whether a treatment is instituted on symptomatic or prognostic grounds.

  input: 'A 54-yr-old male smoker with a history of type II diabetes, hypothyroidism and obstructive sleep  apnoea developed angina on exertion. A coronary angiogram showed that several cardiac vessels  were critically occluded. Severe aortic stenosis was also diagnosed. Coronary artery bypass grafting  and aortic valve replacement were performed. The patient had a good post-operative recovery and  was assigned to cardiac rehabilitation and started on warfarin. Some weeks into the programme,  he starts to complain of a cough, low-grade fever and worsening dyspnoea. A chest radiograph  shows a moderate left-sided pleural effusion. A thoracentesis reveals the following: pH 7.35; glucose 3.5 mmol⋅L−1; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 590 U⋅L−1; and protein concentration 3.8 g⋅dL−1.  Differential cell count revealed increased lymphocytes. Blood glucose is 5.6 mmol⋅L−1 and serum  LDH is 410 U⋅L−1. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?'
  options:
  - Heart failure
  - Hypothyroidism
  - Primary tuberculosis
  - Post-pericardiotomy syndrome
  - Intrapleural haemorrhage
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The post-pericardiotomy syndrome (PPCS; also known as post-cardiac injury syndrome or postcardiotomy syndrome) refers to the occurrence of fever and pleuropericardial disease days or  months after cardiac injury. Patients typically present within 1 week to 3 months. The condition  is characterised by pericarditis with chest pain and a pericardial rub, fever, leukocytosis, and an  elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A pleural friction rub is a common feature. In PPCS  the effusion is an exudate (elevated LDH and protein). In heart failure, the pleural effusion has  a normal pH similar to that in the blood and the effusion is a transudate. Hypothyroidism may  be associated with pleural effusions but not with low-grade fever and cough. There is no hint  from the patient’s history that an intrapleural haemorrhage was a likely cause of the effusion  and blood would be easily detected during thoracentesis.

  input: Which of the following statements about symptoms and signs of lung cancer is/are correct?
  options:
  - Horner syndrome indicates extrathoracic metastases.
  - Cushing syndrome includes hyperkalaemic acidosis and hyperglycaemia.
  - Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome may be worse in the morning and improve during the  day.
  - The severity of neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes is related to tumour bulk.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome may be worse in the morning and improve  during the day. Horner syndrome refers to the triad of miosis, ipsilateral ptosis and lack of facial sweating. It is  caused by infiltration of the sympathetic chain and stellate ganglion by lung cancer (i.e. intrathoracic, not extrathoracic, spread). Cushing syndrome may be the result of ectopic production of  adrenocorticotropic hormone by small cell lung cancer. Clinical manifestations include weakness, muscle wasting, drowsiness, confusion, dependent oedema, moon facies, hypertension,  hypokalaemic alkalosis, and hyperglycaemia. Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is  characterised by gradual onset of proximal lower extremity weakness while proximal upper  extremity weakness is usually less noticeable. Improvement of muscular strength with repeated  testing is a distinctive symptom of LEMS and muscular weakness may improve during the day.  The severity of the symptoms is not correlated with the
    tumour bulk. Even very small cancers  may produce paraneoplastic syndromes. Typical paraneoplastic syndromes such as LEMS, stiff  man syndrome or Cushing syndrome warrant a search for a tumour.

  input: A 74-year-old previously healthy male presents to the emergency department with new onset  of dyspnoea on mild exertion and a 10-day history of right calf swelling. He has fainted twice  this morning, his blood pressure is 85/55 mmHg; his heart rate is 130 beats per min and regular.  Arterial blood gases reveal a PaO2 7.4 kPa (56 mmHg), PaCO2 of 3.7 kPa (28 mmHg) and pH of 7.47.  Brain natriuretic polypeptide (BNP) and D-dimer are both elevated three-fold above the normal  limit. A CT angiogram (angio-CT) confirms massive embolism of the common pulmonary artery  reaching through the pulmonary valve. Which of the following is the appropriate initial therapy for this patient?
  options:
  - 10-mg bolus of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator intravenously, then 90 mg  over 2 h
  - 5000 IU heparin intravenously, followed by 25 000 IU over 24 h
  - 15 000 IU low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously once daily
  - Pulmonary artery catheter and selective intra-arterial thrombolysis
  - Surgical embolectomy of the pulmonary artery
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: The patient has suffered massive pulmonary embolism (PE) with a consecutive cardiogenic  shock. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in haemodynamically  unstable patients (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) is likely to reduce mortality compared to  heparin in patients with massive PE. Surgical embolectomy and selective intra-embolic thrombolysis through a pulmonary artery catheter are second-line options for massive PE in the proximal pulmonary arteries if systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated.

  input: Which of the following statements concerning initiation of β-blocker treatment in patients with  advanced COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease grade 3 or 4) on inhalation therapy with a long-acting β-agonist and inhaled corticosteroids is/are correct?
  options:
  - β-blockers are contraindicated.
  - Initiation of cardioselective β-blocker therapy should only be performed after measuring reversibility of airflow obstruction to inhaled β-agonists.
  - β-blockers increase the risk of exacerbations in patients with advanced COPD.
  - β-blockers reduce mortality in advanced COPD patients with overt cardiovascular diseases.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Historically, β-blockers have been avoided in asthma because of the risk of acute bronchospasm.  These concerns have also been applied to COPD, with evidence of a reduction in FEV1, increased  airway hyperresponsiveness and inhibition of bronchodilator response to β-adrenergic agonists  in patients receiving nonselective β-blockers and high doses of cardioselective β-blockers. Despite the established benefits of β-blockers in treating hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure, many doctors are reluctant to prescribe β-blockers for patients with  concurrent COPD. However, β-blockers are highly efficacious in the treatment of congestive  heart failure and ischaemic coronary syndromes, and can reduce the total mortality of patients  with these disorders by 30–40%. A nonrandomised trial by Rutten et al. (2010) showed that  the use of β-blockers, contrary to classic teaching, is not only safe but can also prolong survival  and reduce exacerbations in COPD. Other retrospective
    studies confirmed these results, demonstrating that β-blockers may reduce mortality, hospital admissions and COPD exacerbations  when added to established inhaled therapy for COPD, independently of overt cardiovascular  disease and cardiac drugs, and without adverse effects on pulmonary function. In conclusion, β-blockers are not contraindicated in COPD.

Her best recorded peak expiratory flow is 60% of her  personal best and she has a SpO2 of 90%. She has stopped taking inhaled corticosteroids because  she is 27 weeks pregnant and does not feel comfortable receiving medication while she is pregnant.  She has been having mild symptoms for weeks. Now the symptoms have been getting worse and  she has been waking at night for the past 10 days. She feels breathless and although she has used  her relief inhaler every day in the past week and 3 times in the last hour, she does not feel better. Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?
  options:
  - High-dose inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting β-agonists.
  - Oxygen supplementation, high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting β-agonists.
  - Oral and inhaled corticosteroids and oxygen supplementation.
  - Systemic corticosteroids and short-acting β-agonists.
  - Oxygen supplementation, systemic corticosteroids and short-acting β-agonists.
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: 'This patient shows uncontrolled asthma since she is having more than two of the following  symptoms: daytime symptoms more than twice a week; limitation of activities; nocturnal symptoms; need for relief medication more than twice a week; lung function <80% of personal best.  Inhaled steroids are not enough for this pregnant woman who has been uncontrolled for days.  Acute asthma exacerbations should be managed in hospital with fetal monitoring and with use  of steroids as needed. Maternal SaO2 should be kept above 95%.'

  input: A 45-year-old, HIV-positive male is admitted to the hospital because of fever and severe dyspnoea.  Physical examination shows tachypnoea and tachycardia. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral fine  crackles. Radiography shows extensive, bilateral, patchy lung infiltrates. Arterial blood gas analysis  on room air reveals a PaO2 of 6.0 kPa (45 mmHg), PaCO2 of 1.5 kPa (11 mmHg) and pH of 7.56. He  is intubated, and positive pressure ventilation is initiated with an inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2)  of 0.5 and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cmH2O. Arterial blood gas analysis after half an  hour demonstrates a PaO2 of 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg), PaCO2 of 3.0 kPa (22 mmHg) and pH of 7.52.  Brain natriuretic peptide concentration is normal, and echocardigraphy shows normal systolic and  diastolic function as well as normal respiratory variation of the inferior vena cava size.  Which of the following statements regarding this patient is/are correct?
  options:
  - A diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome can be made.
  - The alveolar–arterial oxygen tension difference is corrected by oxygen administration.
  - The intrapulmonary shunt increases with increasing FIO2.
  - Prone position during positive pressure ventilation improves survival.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: The diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is based on chest radiography (i.e.  bilateral infiltrates not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse or nodules), arterial  blood gas findings (i.e. PaO2/FIO2 ratio ≤40 kPa (≤300 mmHg)) and the presence of respiratory  failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, verified by objective assessment  (echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide). In the present case, arterial hypoxaemia is  only partially corrected by oxygen administration (PaO2/FIO2 13.4 kPa (100 mmHg)). It has been  demonstrated that the degree of intrapulmonary shunting increases with increasing FIO2; the  clinician should be aware of this when assessing the severity of respiratory failure by using the  PaO2/FIO2 ratio. A recent trial has shown that early application of prone-position ventilation in  patients with severe ARDS decreases 28- and 90-day mortality. The alveolar–arterial oxygen tension difference is not
    corrected by oxygen administration. In  addition to increasing intrapulmonary shunting, oxygen administration does not correct underlying pathophysiological changes that occur due to capillary endothelial damage and alveolar  epithelial damage, i.e. interstitial oedema due to increased protein influx in to the interstitial  space and consecutive increase in oncotic pressure, and filling of the alveoli with oedema fluid  and cellular debris. Additional loss of surfactant leads to alveolar collapse.

The daytime fatigue and poor sleep quality with frequent nocturnal awakenings are consistent with  this differential diagnosis, since patients with heart failure may have nocturia and nocturnal  Cheyne–Stokes respiration (CSR) leading to sleep disruption. Daytime fatigue and reduced  exercise capacity are also typical symptoms of chronic heart failure. Factors associated with  an increased risk of suffering from CSR in patients with heart failure include a higher New York  Heart Association functional class, older age, severe heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction of <45%), atrial fibrillation and a reduced exercise capacity. Typically, heart failure patients  with CSR tend to chronically hyperventilate, which contributes to breathing instability because  it drives PaCO2 close to the
    apnoea threshold. The patient has several of the cited factors associated with CSR. Therefore, performing a sleep study is indicated and might reveal CSR, a condition that can be treated with nocturnal CPAP or adaptive servoventilation (if left ventricular  ejection fraction is >45%) after optimisation of drug therapy if appropriate. Adaptive servoventilation has been shown to improve nocturnal CSR, sleep quality and daytime performance, but  recent data suggest that it is associated with excess mortality in patients with severely impaired  left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction <45%). The pulmonary function tests suggest mild restriction and impaired pulmonary diffusion, consistent with congestive heart failure. Performing body plethysmography might help to confirm  reduced lung volumes but will not result in a change of treatment. As a former smoker, the patient might suffer from emphysema or lung cancer that can be  detected by chest CT even if the conventional chest
    radiograph shows a normal lung parenchyma. However, CSR is a more likely cause of her complaints and is more amenable to  treatment. Echocardiography might help to grade heart failure severity but is unlikely to alter therapeutic  management. Measuring brain natriuretic peptide is useful to monitor patients with heart failure but also might not provide information leading to changes in treatment.

  input: Which of the following statements about anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is/are correct?
  options:
  - 'Anti-TB drugs have three major principles of action: bactericidal action, sterilisation and prevention of emergence of bacterial resistance.'
  - Streptomycin is included in the standard recommended regimen for the treatment of TB as it  has a lower resistance rate than ethambutol.
  - If pyrazinamide cannot be used, the standard recommended regimen for the treatment of TB  has to be given for 12 months.
  - Initial cavitation and positive sputum culture after 2 months of correct treatment justify the  prolongation of the continuation phase of anti-TB therapy to give a total duration of 9 months.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - D
  rationale: Anti-TB drugs have the major actions listed above. The initial standard regimen includes the  four drugs isoniazid (INH), rifampizin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 2 months followed by  INH and rifampicin for an additional 4 months if mycobateriae are sensitive to these drugs.  Streptomycin is not included in the standard regimen because it has more undesirable effects,  such as renal toxicity and ototoxicity, has a higher resistance rate than ethambutol and is injectable and therefore difficult to administer. If the bactericidal drug pyrazinamide cannot be used,  the treatment has to be given for 9 months instead of the standard 6 months. The Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention states that cavitation and positive culture after 2 months of  treatment justifies a prolongation of the continuation phase to 9 months, since the relapse rate  in patients with these risk factors is 10 times as high as that in patients without cavitation or  positive culture after 2 months
    (21% versus 2%).

  input: At which of the following points does the maximum flow–volume curve cross the volume axis?
  options:
  - Expiratory reserve volume and FVC
  - Functional residual capacity and FVC
  - Residual volume and TLC
  - Minimum and maximum expiratory flow
  - Maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Spirometry is expressed graphically as volume–time and flow–volume curves (figure). In the  flow–volume curve, lung volumes are plotted along the horizontal axis and flow is plotted up  the vertical axis, conventionally with expiratory flow as positive and inspiratory flow as negative values. The maximal flow–volume curve is obtained when after inhalation to maximal lung  capacity (TLC), a forced exhalation follows until no more air can be exhaled (residual volume  (RV)). Therefore, the correct answer is RV and TLC. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is the lung volume at the end of passive exhalation during  tidal breathing and can only be detected when tidal breathing is recorded (figure). Expiratory  reserve volume is the volume between FRC and RV that, again, is not recorded when forced  exhalation is maintained until RV is reached.

  input: A 57-year-old male previously diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) presents with a  cough and dyspnoea for 1 week. He has a history of night sweats. Examination shows a right-sided  pleural effusion. A thoracentesis of the effusion reveals a milky fluid. Which one of the following statements concerning the pleural fluid is most likely to be true?
  options:
  - It has a low concentration of immunoglobulins.
  - It has a low pH.
  - Its electrolyte content is lower than that of the serum.
  - Fasting makes it less milky in colour.
  - It has a high level of eosinophils.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The vignette describes a chylous pleural effusion. Chylothoraces occur more commonly in NHL  than in Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In NHL, chylothoraces are responsible for about 19% of all pleural  effusions. Chyle has a high content of triglycerides in the form of chylomicrons, which produce  the milky, opalescent appearance of lymphatic fluid. This milky appearance may clear during a  fast and rapidly returns after eating of a meal containing fat. The electrolyte content of chyle is  similar to that of plasma, and the protein concentration is usually greater than 3 g per L. Chyle  is also rich in immunoglobulins and contains the fat-soluble vitamins absorbed from the intestines. Chyle contains lymphocytes, not eosinophils, as the major cellular component. A low pH  in a pleural effusion is due to metabolic activity in empyema and sometimes in a cancer-related  effusion. Chylothorax is not acidic.

  - Ciprofloxacin
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The most common cause for the community-acquired pneumonia of this patient is Streptococcus  pneumoniae. Due to the high antibiotic resistance for erythromycin and possibly co-trimoxazole in  this case, these are not preferable options for empirical antibiotic treatment. Regimens including anti-pseudomonal β-lactams (such as ceftazidime) and aminoglycosides (such as amikacin)  are indicated in cases with increased risk for Pseudomonas infections. However, this is not the  case for the vignette case with moderate airflow obstruction and no history of antibiotic use  in the past year. The preferred treatment option is a non-anti-pseudomonal β-lactam (such  as ceftriaxone) plus a newer macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone  (such as moxifloxacin or levofloxacin), but not ciprofloxacin. In certain areas of Europe different resistance patterns are observed that require specific adaptation of empiric antibiotic therapy.

  input: An obese 60-year-old man complains of dyspnoea on exertion that has slowly progressed over  the past year. He has no haemoptysis, chest pain, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.  Cardiovascular examination reveals a pulse rate of 102 beats per min, a blood pressure of  130/80 mmHg and distant heart sounds. The lungs are clear. Chest radiography shows borderline  cardiomegaly with normal lung fields. Right-sided catheterisation of the heart shows a pulmonary  capillary wedge pressure of 20 mmHg, and systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressures  of 45, 27 and 33 mmHg, respectively. Which is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Chronic thromboembolism
  - Schistosomiasis
  - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
  - Chronic sclerosing mediastinitis
  - Pulmonary hypertension from ingestion of tryptophan diet supplements
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: "Pulmonary hypertension is defined as an increased mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)  ≥25 mmHg at rest as assessed by right heart catheterisation. Pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension includes clinical groups 1 and 3–5 while postcapillary pulmonary hypertension includes clinical group 2. \nAccording to values of PAWP and PAP, the patient described in the vignette belongs to group 2  and the most likely diagnosis seems to be due to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction  (diastolic dysfunction). In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is not elevated (<15 mmHg). Eggs of Schistosoma can produce pulmonary hypertension. Patients infected by Schistososma  generally present with a classical form of pulmonary hypertension, including a significant  increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and, consequently, right heart failure. Pulmonary  hypertension associated with schistosomiasis belongs to group 1. Schistosomiasis would also\
    \  cause a pattern of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension. In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary  hypertension, the PAWP is usually <15 mmHg. Chronic sclerosing mediastinitis does not cause elevated PAWP and there is no evidence of this  disease on the chest radiograph. Severe interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension have been described in l-tryptophaninduced ‘eosinophilia myalgia syndrome’ but are associated with other systemic symptoms that  may include, joint pain, weakness, fever, dyspnoea, cough, fatigue, oedema, rash, sclerodermalike skin changes, hair loss, neuropathy, eosinophilia and severe myalgia."

  input: Which of the following options is of highest value for the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis  (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)?
  options:
  - Exposure to a known offending antigen
  - Eosinophils in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid
  - Serum precipitins
  - Delayed response to corticosteroids
  - Inspiratory squeaks on auscultation
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: 'Identifying the offending antigens is key to a definite diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  Therefore, thorough clinical history and evaluation of possible exposure to antigens known to  induce hypersensitivity pneumonitis is essential. Furthermore, a removal of suspected sources  or environments for 2–3 weeks and a re-exposure challenge could be performed to support the  diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) typically shows a marked lymphocytosis (>20% of recovered leukocytes) with a CD4+/CD8+ ratio of <1.0 (normal ratio: 2.3). BAL lymphocytosis accompanied by  elevated levels of mast cells (>1%) can be seen in acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Additional  elevated levels of elevated BAL neutrophils >5%, at times accompanied by eosinophils >5% of  recovered leukocytes are sometimes seen in advanced disease. Serum precipitins have a high rate of false negative results in acute and chronic hypersensitivity  pneumonitis. In addition,
    intense and prolonged exposure to antigens, such as in farmers or  bird fanciers may lead to positive serum precipitin reactions without a clinical correlate. Specific  circulating antibodies are evidence of sensitisation but not of disease and should be seen as a  marker of exposure. However, a positive test in the appropriate clinical setting and the selection  of an appropriate panel of antigens most likely to be encountered in the patient’s respective  environment supports the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Therefore, indiscriminate  serum precipitin panels are not as helpful for the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It has been shown that systemic glucocorticoids accelerate initial recovery, particularly in  severely ill patients and improve diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide after a  month of treatment. Treatment is usually tapered over the course of 4–8 weeks. While inspiratory crackles are one of the significant predictors of hypersensitivity
    pneumonitis,  end-inspiratory squeaks are associated with bronchiolitis.'

  input: A 75-year-old female is admitted to the emergency department after a car accident. Besides complaining of lower back pain and some bruising of the chest, the patient seems well. She has been  treated for rheumatoid arthritis for many years with methotrexate. Vital signs and physical examination do not reveal any abnormalities. The chest radiograph is normal except for spine osteophytic  degeneration. Two days after being sent home with analgesic treatment, the patient returns to the emergency  department. She now complains of dyspnoea. Physical examination reveals reduced breath sounds  on the left lung base. The chest radiograph shows a moderate-sized left pleural effusion but no  pulmonary infiltrates. Pleural fluid with a milky appearance is drained. Which of the following pleural fluid analyses confirms the suspected diagnosis?
  options:
  - Cholesterol concentration
  - Triglycerides concentration
  - Gram and Ziehl–Neelsen staining
  - Rheumatoid factors
  - Methotrexate concentration
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Based on the history and the milky appearance of the pleural fluid, a rupture of the ductus thoracicus is the most likely diagnosis. A haemothorax can be excluded by the non-bloody appearance of the effusion. The first chest radiograph did not show any effusion; therefore, chronic  conditions such as tuberculosis or a rheumatoid pleuritis are unlikely. Methotrexate may cause  interstitial pneumonitis but pleural effusion is not a typical side-effect of the drug and its measurement in pleural fluid would not contribute to confirming the diagnosis. Acute infection with  empyema is also unlikely, as the patient did not have fever nor did the radiograph show pulmonary infiltrates; unlike chylothorax, the pleural fluid in empyema clears after centrifugation.  Trauma and lung cancer cause pseudochylothoraces in rare cases. They develop after longstanding pleural effusion and it is assumed that cell lysis releases cholesterol, which is poorly  absorbed through the pleural membrane.
    A traumatic thoracic duct lesion, as in the described  case, accounts for ∼50% of cases of chylothorax. Elevated triglyceride levels (>1.24 mmol⋅L−1)  or presence of chylomicrons confirm the diagnosis of a chylothorax.

  input: Which of the following statements about small cell carcinoma is true?
  options:
  - Approximately 80% of the patients with limited small cell carcinoma show good initial  responses to treatment by showing clinical regression of symptoms and radiological regression  of tumour size.
  - When it presents as a peripheral lesion, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 50%.
  - Whole-brain irradiation administered prophylactically has been shown to increase the survival  rate and should be given to all patients.
  - Superior vena cava syndrome from tumour obstruction adversely affects regression of tumour  size with therapy.
  - Hypercalcaemia from production of ectopic parathyroid hormone is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome.
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Most patients with either limited or extensive disease initially respond to treatment. The median  survival for limited disease is 18–24 months with a 5-year survival of 20–25%. For extensive disease, the median survival is 9–10 months, with <10% of patients alive at 2 years. Prophylactic  cranial irradiation is not recommended in all patients but only in those who achieve a complete  or partial response to initial therapy. It prolongs survival in these patients. Hypercalcaemia due  to ectopic parathyroid hormone production is a paraneoplastic syndrome usually associated  with squamous cell lung cancer.

  input: A 63-year-old male is admitted to hospital because of dyspnoea, without fever. The patient reports  mild dyspnoea on exertion during the last year. He is short of breath in the mornings, specifically  when getting out of bed. Physical examination reveals the use of respiratory accessory muscles;  breath sounds are slightly decreased and no jugular venous distension is present. On the abdomen,  there are occasional spider naevi, and hepatomegaly and ascites are noted. Oxygen saturation is  86% in the sitting position and increases to 91% with the patient lying down. Laboratory blood  tests, including white blood cell count, D-dimer, brain natriuretic protein, troponin and myoglobin, and ECG, are normal. Chest radiography shows cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions.  Ultrasound-guided paracentesis is performed and 1 L fluid is removed. Fluid examination reveals a  polymorphonuclear cell count of 100×106 cells per L, a protein concentration of 3.9 g⋅dL−1, and no  organisms
    on Gram stain and culture. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Pneumonia
  - Hepatopulmonary syndrome
  - Pulmonary embolism
  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
  - Chronic heart failure
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Pneumonia can be excluded because of the absence of fever, blood leukocytosis and pulmonary  infiltrates on the chest radiograph. Pulmonary embolism is ruled out by normal D-dimers. Chronic  heart failure is unlikely because of the normal chest radiograph, absence of jugular venous distension and normal brain natriuretic protein. Since no organisms were identified on Gram stain  and culture of ascitic fluid, and the polymorphonuclear cell count was <250×106 cells per L,  the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be excluded. The most likely diagnosis is  hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Characteristic signs of HPS are platypnoea (i.e. the increase  in dyspnoea from the supine to upright position) and associated orthodeoxia (i.e. the decrease  in PaO2 (or SpO2) from the supine to the upright position).

  input: A 75-year-old ex-smoker with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grade 2)  using long-acting bronchodilators has had shortness of breath, increased sputum expectoration  and fever for 5 days. His heart rate is 115 beats per min, respiratory rate is 36 breaths per min,  blood pressure is 100/65 mmHg and body temperature is 38.6°C, and he seems slightly confused.  On lung auscultation, you hear crackles, mainly in the right lung, and diffuse wheezes. Which of the following is the best choice for the further management of this patient?
  options:
  - Hospitalisation, intravenous antibiotics and corticosteroids
  - Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and a short-acting bronchodilator
  - Levofloxacin and corticosteroids
  - Ciprofloxacin and inhaled corticosteroids
  - Increased bronchodilator and clarithromycin
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: 'This patient has suspected community-acquired pneumonia, defined by acute illness with  cough meeting at least one of the following criteria: new focal chest signs; fever for >4 days or  dyspnoea/tachypnoea; and no other obvious cause. A definitive diagnosis of pneumonia would  be supported by a chest radiograph showing consolidation. Community-acquired pneumonia  is a common and potentially very serious disease, especially in the elderly and in the presence of comorbidities. This 75-year-old patient with COPD has an increased respiratory rate  (>30 breaths per min) and is slightly confused. Although his blood pressure is not <90 mmHg  systolic or <60 mmHg diastolic, several factors associated with an increased risk of mortality are present and he should thus be hospitalised. The CRB-65 score (confusion, respiratory  rate >30 breaths per min, blood pressure <90 mmHg systolic or <60 mmHg diastolic, and age  >65 years) is 3. A score ≥1 (other than age >65 years alone) should
    prompt hospitalisation.'

  input: A 16-year-old boy presents with his parents for evaluation of severe daytime somnolence. The  patient had been healthy until the beginning of the school year, when he started to have increasing difficulty getting out of bed for school in the morning. He frequently misses the bus due to his  tardiness, and after arriving at school he has difficulty staying focused on class work and sometimes  dozes off. He has failed his examinations. His parents do not feel that he snores excessively and  they have never witnessed apnoeas or unusual motor activity during his sleep. The patient typically goes to bed by 22:30–23:00 h but he often watches television in bed, sometimes to as late as  04:00 h. His parents have discouraged him from staying up so late but he notes that if he turns off  the lights at 22:30 h, he is unable to sleep for several hours. On weekends, he often sleeps until  14:00–15:00 h. Sleep hygiene measures have not worked. Which one of the following is the most appropriate
    next step for this patient?
  options:
  - Human leukocyte antigen typing
  - Schedule a multiple sleep latency test
  - Prescribe methylphenidate 10 mg, to be administered every morning
  - Instruct the patient to record a sleep diary and advance his sleeping time
  - Request a screening nocturnal oximetry study
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The patient suffers from daytime hypersomnia, which can be caused by a large variety of underlying causes and can also appear idiopathically. A circadian rhythm disorder (delayed sleep phase  syndrome) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. A shift of the sleep–wake distribution towards  the day is typical in puberty. However, the degree described here is uncommon. Nevertheless,  sleep habits, the amount of sleeping hours and the distribution of sleep throughout the 24-h  period should be evaluated by a sleep diary as a first step in diagnostic evaluation. Actigraphy  can be used to support sleep diary findings. Moreover, it may help to feed sleep characteristics  back to the patient and to adapt these stepwise to social demands, such as school start. The multiple sleep latency test and human leukocyte antigen testing are used in the diagnosis of narcolepsy, while nocturnal oximetry aids evaluation of sleep related breathing disorders.  However, the history does not support
    either of these disorders. Melatonin to help advance  sleep time, bright light therapy in the morning and methylphenidate may be indicated it in some  cases of hypersomnia, but attempts to make a diagnosis should be made first.

  input: A 38-year-old black female is admitted to the hospital because of a 1-year history of dyspnoea on  exertion, mild fever and muscle fatigue. She has never smoked. On admission, her blood pressure is  115/70 mmHg, pulse rate is 125 beats per min and rhythmic, and respiratory rate is 26 beats per  min. Erythema nodosum is detected on the extensor aspects of the lower legs. Auscultation reveals  bilateral fine crepitation in the posterior chest middle fields. In a chest radiograph, unilateral hilar  adenopathy and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are detected. Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria are  the only abnormal laboratory tests. Which of the following statements is most appropriate?
  options:
  - Spontaneous remission does not occur.
  - Guidelines suggest an initial dose of 5–10 mg prednisone per day.
  - 2 weeks are sufficient to evaluate the response to steroid treatment.
  - Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria are absolute indications for treatment.
  - Methotrexate may be used instead of steroids.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: This case describes the typical clinical presentation of acute sarcoidosis, with hilar adenopathy, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria and erythema nodosum.  Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of undetermined aetiology. It is characterised  by a variable clinical presentation and course. The lung is the most frequently organ involved.  Spontaneous remissions occur in nearly two-thirds of patients. There are few absolute indications for treatment, including cardiac and neurological involvement, hypercalcaemia and  hypercalciuria, and ocular disease, that do not respond to topical therapy. The main treatment  consists in corticosteroid administration. Guidelines suggest an initial dose of oral prednisone  at a dose of 20–40 mg per day and to evaluate the effect of treatment after 1–3 months.  Methotrexate has been used widely as a steroid-sparing agent for sarcoidosis but has not been  tested as a single therapy.

  options:
  - Increase FEV1
  - Improve the methacholine threshold
  - Decrease the frequency of exacerbations
  - Decrease the use of inhaled corticosteroids
  correct_answer:

  input: A 25-year-old African female presents to the emergency department. She has reportedly just completed a short-distance flight from Paris to London. She complains that she is short of breath, and  has a cough and pain when taking deep breaths. She was in a good health until 1 week prior to her  trip, when she developed a cold. On examination, she has pale conjunctivae. The chest examination  shows a pleural rub but is otherwise normal. She has bilateral chronic leg ulcers. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Bornholm disease
  - Pneumothorax
  - Acute chest syndrome
  - Fat embolism
  - Pneumonia
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Acute chest syndrome is one of the manifestations of sickle cell disease. The aetiology is not  absolutely clear but it is thought to be caused by pulmonary vaso-occlusion either through fat  emboli from the bone-marrow or through pulmonary microvascular thrombosis triggered by  infection, especially community-acquired pneumonia. Tobacco smoke exposure is a possible  risk factor. Acute chest syndrome often progresses to respiratory failure. The syndrome is the  leading cause of death among sickle cell disease patients. Treatment is symptomatic with transfusions and bronchodilators. The Wells score shows a low probability of a pulmonary embolism and a short-distance flight  does not lead to long immobilisation; therefore, deep vein thrombosis is rather unlikely. Pale  conjunctivae and leg ulcers are not associated with pneumothorax or pneumonia. Fat embolism, which is not associated with sickle cell crisis, is usually iatrogenic or trauma-related. There  is no indication of any
    of these problems, and there is no connection between chronic leg ulcers  and pale conjunctivae to non-sickle cell crisis associated fat embolism. Bornholm disease or  epidemic pleurodynia is typically caused by coxsackievirus B. There is no indication in this case  of epidemic chest pain, or any other coxsackievirus B-associated diseases like myopericarditis  or meningitis.

  input: A 69-year-old teacher is consulting you as he has felt excessively sleepy during the day for several  years. He reports almost having had an accident while driving on the motorway about 1 year ago  due to lack of concentration. Recently, he hit a parked car because he had fallen asleep at the  wheel. He complains of difficulty initiating night sleep and frequent awakenings, and he does not  feel refreshed in the morning. His wife reports that he is a snorer and extremely restless during  the night but she does not remember whether he has breathing pauses during the night. Another  physician has performed nocturnal pulse oximetry, which showed 13 oxygen desaturations of >2%  per h, 1% of the recording time with SpO2 <90% and an irregular pulse rate. Regarding the diagnosis, which of the following statements is most appropriate in this case?
  options:
  - Nocturnal polysomnography will provide important additional information.
  - Pulse oximetry is diagnostic for sleep disordered breathing.
  - Pulse oximetry rules out sleep apnoea syndrome.
  - A multiple sleep latency test might be diagnostic.
  - A 24-h ECG will reveal the cause of his symptoms.
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Oximetry can be useful as a simple tool to diagnose OSA but cannot be relied on to rule out a  diagnosis of OSA and is less reliable in mild cases or in patients with upper airway resistance  syndrome. The sensitivity of nocturnal pulse oximetry in the diagnosis of OSA ranges from 31%  to 98% and specificity ranges from 41% to 100%. Pulse oximetry may lead to misdiagnosis in  patients with pulmonary disease such as COPD and associated nocturnal hypoventilation or  heart failure. A multiple sleep latency test will confirm short sleep latency but not the cause of  this. 24-h ECG may show sinus arrhythmia or other arrhythmia but will not reveal the diagnosis  of sleep disorder. Polysomnography will add extra information on causes of poor sleep initiation,  including periodic limb movements, and it will show arousals, and classify obstructive apnoeas  and hypopnoeas, giving an accurate AHI.

  input: Which one of following measures is least predictive of the risk of death in COPD patients?
  options:
  - BMI
  - Walking distance
  - Haematocrit
  - FEV1
  - Dyspnoea score
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Studies in COPD patients have shown that age, FVC, FEV1, inspiratory capacity, modified Medical  Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score, 6-min walk distance, BMI, haematocrit and comorbidity measured by the Charlson index are all associated with the risk of death. The strongest  associations were found with BMI (B), FEV1 as measure of airflow obstruction (O), mMRC dyspnoea score (D) and exercise capacity measured by the 6-min walk distance. These variables  were therefore incorporated into the BODE index.

  rationale: The patient’s clinical history (recent orthopaedic surgery), clinical signs and symptoms (tachycardia and tachypnoea with pleuritic pain), and blood gas analysis showing hypoxaemia with  hypocapnia, with the absence of radiographic signs that could be suspicious of a lung infection,  seem more likely to be related to acute pulmonary embolism than to a lung infection. According  to European Society of Cardiology pulmonary embolism guidelines, in patients with a high probability of pulmonary embolism, parenteral anticoagulation should be initiated while awaiting  diagnostic tests. Low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux are preferred over unfractionated heparin for initial anticoagulation, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and  heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In this case with a high probability of pulmonary embolism, a CT pulmonary angiography must be performed as the next step after administration of  low molecular weight heparin. D-dimer testing is
    not indicated, as it is used in low-probability  settings.

  input: A 68-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with cough, sputum production and  fever up to 39.5˚C in the past 48 h. He has COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung  Disease grade 4), and uses daily tiotropium and albuterol as needed. His diabetes mellitus is well  controlled with metformin. He has a confirmed allergy to amoxicillin. On physical examination, he  is tachypnoeic (30 breaths per min) and tachycardic (110 beats per min), with a blood pressure  of 130/90 mmHg. He is alert and fully oriented. On auscultation, he has bilateral wheezing and  crepitation on the right lung base. His laboratory tests reveal white blood count 14 000 cells per μL,  C-reactive protein 30 mg⋅L−1, blood urea concentration 10 mmol⋅L−1 and SpO2 82%, on inhaled oxygen fraction 0.21. Chest radiography shows consolidation in the right upper and lower lung fields. Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic regimen for this patient?
  options:
  - Oral azithromycin
  - Oral ciprofloxacin
  - Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin
  - Intravenous moxifloxacin and azithromycin
  - Intravenous aztreonam and moxifloxacin
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: 'The patient has severe community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65 score 3) involving at  least two lobes. Therefore, and because of his comorbidities (COPD and diabetes) and severe  hypoxaemia, he needs to be treated in the hospital, ideally in a high-dependency or intensive  care unit. The risk of pseudomonal infection should be assessed to guide empirical antibiotic  therapy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in COPD patients should be considered in the presence of at least two of the following: 1) recent hospitalisation; 2) frequent exacerbations (more  than four courses of antibiotics per year); 3) severe COPD (FEV1 <30% predicted); and 4) oral  steroid use (>10 mg prednisolone daily in the past 2 weeks). Thus, there is no evidence of  P. aeruginosa infection in this patient. The preferred regimen in this setting would be a non-antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin and a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) or a macrolide (a new  macrolide such
    as azithromycin would be preferred over erythromycin). However, the patient is  allergic to penicillin. Therefore, the usual cephalosporin has to be substituted with aztreonam,  a monobactam, which has been shown to be safe to use in patients with penicillin allergy.  Oral antibiotics are not an option in severely ill patients. Several scores have been developed to  assess severity of pneumonia and associated mortality. Two well-validated and simple scores  are the CURB-65 and its derivative that does not require a laboratory study compared the two scores. Using the CURB-65 index, pneumonia is considered mild  (score 0–1, mortality 1.5%), moderate (score 2, mortality 9.2%) or severe (score 3–5, mortality  22%). Using the CRB-65 index, pneumonia is considered mild (score 0, mortality 1.5%), moderate (score 1–2, mortality 8.2%) or severe (score 3–4, mortality 31%). In patients with a CRB-65  ≥1 (except age ≥65 years alone), hospitalisation should be seriously considered.'

  input: Which of the following statements about hypersensitivity pneumonitis is not correct?
  options:
  - Alveolitis is due to an infiltration of the lung parenchyma by inflammatory cells.
  - Cellular content of the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with hypersensitivity  pneumonitis is higher than that observed in controls.
  - The inflammatory cells are mostly lymphocytes.
  - The majority of lymphocytes express B-cell markers.
  - The CD4/CD8 ratio is usually low.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immunologically mediated inflammatory disease of the lung.  It is caused by hypersensitivity to a variety of inhaled organic or inorganic antigens. Due to  inflammation in the lung, interstitium and alveoli bronchoalveolar lavage shows high total cell  and lymphocyte counts with accumulation of activated T-lymphocytes. Usually there is predominance of the CD8 T-lymphocytes subset resulting in a decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio.

  input: A 58-year-old, female never-smoker presents with a mass on the left upper lobe with extensive  mediastinal involvement. Bronchoscopy with biopsy reveals small cell lung cancer. Ipsilateral  paratracheal and precarinal lymph nodes (N2) are cytologically positive but there are no distant  metastases. Which of the following is best treatment?
  options:
  - Radiotherapy
  - Platinum-based chemotherapy
  - Combination chemoradiotherapy
  - Complete resection followed by combined chemoradiotherapy
  - Concurrent chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: This is a case of limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) because the disease is confined to one  hemithorax without extrathoracic metastases (with exception of the ipsilateral supraclavicular  nodes) and can be treated in a single radiation field. In patients with limited-stage SCLC, combination chemoradiotherapy with accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (twice-daily  treatment) concurrent with platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended. Surgical resection  is limited to patients with stage I SCLC after thorough evaluation for distal metastases and invasive mediastinal staging. Platinum-based chemotherapy alone is recommended in extensivestage SCLC. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended in patients with complete or partial  response to the initial therapy but not concurrently with the initial chemotherapy.

  input: A 47-year-old woman comes to your office with 3 days of fever, shortness of breath and cough with  mucoid sputum. On physical examination, she is alert but slightly confused; her temperature is  40°C, respiratory rate is 34 breaths per min and blood pressure is 110/50 mmHg. Examination of  the chest shows bibasal crackles; the chest radiograph shows bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Arterial  blood gases with the patient breathing room air are PaO2 6.1 kPa (46 mmHg) and PaCO2 3.7 kPa  (28 mmHg). She is admitted to the hospital, and therapy with ceftriaxone and clarithromycin is  started. Legionella pneumonia is suspected. Which of the following is/are clinically useful tests for guiding the treatment of this patient?
  options:
  - Urinary antigen test for Legionella
  - Sputum culture for Legionella on selective medium
  - Acute serum titres for Legionella antibodies
  - DNA probe study of bronchoscopically obtained lower respiratory tract secretions
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - D
  rationale: The urinary antigen test is currently the most helpful rapid test. This enzyme immunoassay is  highly specific (>95%), and its sensitivity ranges between 65% and 80%, but it only detects the  most frequent type of Legionella (L. pneumophila serogroup 1; ∼90% of all Legionellaceae infections). Nevertheless, its use has been shown to reduce both mortality and the need for intensive  care. The results are available within hours. Culture from respiratory samples (usually sputum) is important and should be specifically  ordered on suspicion of Legionella pneumonia together with the urinary antigen test. The cultures serve for confirmation and detection of non-L. pneumophila serogroup 1 Legionella infections. Culture results are usually available within 3–4 days. While antibody serology used to be the mainstay test, it has become less important with the  availability of urinary antigen testing, direct immunofluorescence staining and PCR. Because  the definitive criterion for serological
    diagnosis requires a four-fold rise in antibody titre (IgG, or  IgM and IgG) and/or the appearance of IgM titres, repeat serology is required up to 12 weeks  after the onset of infection. A single elevated titre has been shown in up to 16% of healthy  adults. Serology alone is, therefore, not very useful for clinical decision-making and treatment. DNA amplification testing for Legionella by real-time PCR offers results within hours with a high  specificity and sensitivity. This test is particularly useful in patients with suspected legionellosis  but a negative urine antigen test. Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila are fastidious and  difficult to grow in culture but can be detected with PCR assays where available.

  input: A 53-year-old male is diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (limited disease). His performance status is excellent (ECOG 0) and he is offered treatment with a combination of cisplatin and etoposide  for 4–6 cycles. He comes to you for a second opinion. Which of the following should you offer this patient?
  options:
  - Chemoradiotherapy
  - Immediate treatment with topotecan
  - Thoracic radiotherapy
  - Treatment with pemetrexed
  - Chemotherapy as proposed (cisplatin and etoposide)
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Studies have shown that multimodality treatment is better and therefore chemoradiotherapy  is the treatment of choice for SCLC patients with limited disease and good performance status. Small cell lung cancer is a systemic disease and radiotherapy alone is not recommended.  Topotecan should be considered as second-line treatment if the patient relapses but it is not a  first-line treatment. Pemetrexed is used in nonsmall cell lung cancer and in particular adenocarcinoma in first, second or maintenance treatment regimens but it is not used in small cell lung  cancer. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide is the recommended chemotherapy but it is  better combined with radiotherapy.

  input: A 55-year-old chronic alcoholic man, who stopped drinking 2 weeks ago, complains of anorexia,  bone pain, weakness, malaise and epigastric pain for 5 days. While antacids relieve the pain, the  other symptoms persist. When the patient becomes confused, his family brings him to the emergency department. Physical examination reveals generalised muscle weakness and hyporeflexia.  Because an arterial blood gas specimen shows values consistent with acute hypercapnic respiratory  failure, the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. In addition to standard care, which of the following treatments is likely to be most beneficial in  correcting his ventilatory failure?
  options:
  - Plasmapheresis
  - Corticosteroids
  - Activated charcoal
  - Folic acid supplementation
  - Phosphate supplementation
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Hypophosphataemia is frequently observed in alcoholic patients due to various pathophysiological  mechanisms, such as inappropriate phosphaturia, increased phosphorus entry into cells and  increased gastrointestinal loss of phosphate. Excessive antacid use could worsen a pre-existing  hypophosphataemia. Mild hypophosphataemia (i.e. 2–2.5 mg⋅dL−1 (0.6–0.8 mmol·L−1)), whether  acute or chronic, is generally asymptomatic. Patients with severe and/or chronic hypophosphataemia are more likely to be symptomatic. Muscle weakness, bone pain, rhabdomyolysis, skeletal disorders and altered mental status are the most common presenting features in chronic  severe hypophosphataemia. Hypophosphataemia has also been shown to cause acute respiratory failure. The mechanism is believed to be due to decreased high-energy substrate availability at the cellular level leading to respiratory muscle dysfunction. Activated charcoal could  be utilised in gastrointestinal decontamination in overdose patients.
    Folic acid, pyridoxine and  thiamine should be administered to patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal. Corticosteroids  have become a first-line therapy for biopsy-proven, severe alcoholic steatohepatitis.

  input: 'A 65-year-old man was hospitalised for an exacerbation of newly diagnosed COPD. He was discharged  4 weeks ago and now presents to your office for a regular check up in late spring. You perform a  spirometry test with the following results: FVC, 2.52 L (77% predicted); FEV1, 1.53 L (54% predicted);  and FEV1/FVC, 61%. He has now recovered and feels well. He has never received any vaccinations  since childhood. Which preventive approach against pneumonia is appropriate at this time?'
  options:
  - Pneumococcal vaccine
  - Pseudomonas vaccine
  - Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine
  - Influenza vaccine
  - None of the above
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for COPD patients aged ≥65 years as  well as in younger patients with significant comorbid conditions, such as cardiac disease. In  addition, this vaccine has been shown to reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in COPD patients aged <65 years with an FEV1 <40% predicted. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protects against pneumonia even in patients aged >65 years. Despite the recognition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as an opportunistic pathogen in severe  COPD patients, to date, no vaccine against this bacterium has obtained market authorisation. Persons considered at increased risk for invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease include  those with functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV infection, immunoglobulin deficiency (including  immunoglobulin G2 subclass deficiency), or early component complement deficiency, recipients of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant, and those receiving chemotherapy or radiation  therapy
    for malignant neoplasms. H. influenzae type b vaccination is not indicated for COPD  patients. Influenza vaccination can reduce serious illness (such as lower respiratory tract infections  requiring hospitalisation) and death in COPD patients. Vaccines containing killed or live, inactivated viruses are recommended as they are more effective in elderly patients with COPD. The  strains are adjusted each year for appropriate effectiveness and should be given once each year.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that influenza vaccinations begin  soon after the vaccine becomes available, ideally by October. However, as long as influenza  viruses are circulating, it is not too late to vaccinate COPD patients, even in January or later.  While seasonal influenza outbreaks can happen as early as October, most of the time influenza  activity peaks between December and February. Since it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop, it is best that people
    are vaccinated in time to be protected  before influenza viruses begin spreading in their community; so, influenza vaccination in the  late spring is not recommended.

  input: A 64-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of  dyspnoea with pleuritic chest pain in her left hemithorax for the past 3 h. The patient underwent  coronary artery bypass graft surgery 9 months ago and has been in a stable condition ever since.  Her treatment includes a β-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, furosemide and  low-dose aspirin. On examination she is dyspnoeic with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per min;  heart rate is 112 beats per min. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the base of the  left lung. Her ankles are symmetrically swollen and non-tender. SpO2 on room air is 88%. The ECG  reveals a sinus tachycardia of 104 beats per min but no other abnormal findings. Chest radiography  confirms a small pleural effusion on the left side. Which of the following options is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
  options:
  - Thoracentesis
  - Administration of intravenous diuretics and observation
  - Lower-limb ultrasonography
  - Measurement of D-dimer with ELISA
  - Chest CT with contrast
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The history of coronary artery disease, the symmetrical ankle oedema and the small pleural  effusion may be suggestive of heart failure. However, heart failure would not explain pleuritic  chest pain and a unilateral left-sided pleural effusion is rare in heart failure. The fact that the  patient presents with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea and tachypnoea, along  with the small pleural effusion, raises the possibility of pulmonary embolism. Based on the Wells criteria, this patient has a moderate pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism (pulmonary embolism is more likely than alternative diagnosis; heart rate is  >100 beats per min, total score 4.5 points). Therefore, the next appropriate step in the management would be to perform a D-dimer test. A negative D-dimer test with ELISA would rule out  pulmonary embolism. If the D-dimer test is positive, a spiral-CT angiogram should be performed  to confirm or rule out pulmonary embolism since the D-dimer test is
    sensitive but nonspecific. If the pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism is high, a spiral-CT angiogram should be  performed as the following step. If clinical signs suggest deep vein thrombosis of a leg, ultrasonography of the legs might confirm the diagnosis and obviate the need for a CT. Further  investigation of the small pleural effusion by chest ultrasound and thoracentesis could follow if  there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. A therapeutic approach using diuretics should not be attempted prior to the evaluation of pulmonary embolism in this patient with chest pain and pleural effusion.

  input: An 83-year-old male patient is referred to you because of a cough that started 6 months ago. He  brings up some yellow phlegm and he recently noticed a little blood staining within his phlegm.  Furthermore, he felt extremely tired. He had consulted his family physician who had prescribed  antibiotics for 10 days which did not change the cough but the colour of the phlegm turned white.  The chest radiograph revealed an enlarged right hilum. On further evaluation the patient complains about painful ankles and wrists, a diminished appetite  and a weight loss of 5 kg in the last month. In the last month he lost a lot of energy, most of the day  he is lying in his bed or sitting in a chair. He also needs some help with his personal hygiene. Further  investigations revealed a squamous cell carcinoma of his right upper lobe and liver metastases. Which one of the following would be your most appropriate next therapeutic option?
  options:
  - Best supportive care
  - Gemcitabin
  - Platinum containing doublet chemotherapy
  - Erlotinib
  - Bevacizumab
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: This patient has stage IV squamous cell carcinoma with a poor performance score (World  Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) stage 3–4) for which  (palliative) chemotherapy is not indicated, except erlotinib for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive patients. Because of the low incidence (less than 3.6%) of EGFR  mutations, routine testing for them should not be performed. Two-drug regimens are preferred.  A third drug improves only response rate, not survival. Platinum-based therapy prolongs survival, improves symptom control and quality of life in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. In  squamous cell carcinoma the gemcitabin/cisplatin combination shows superior efficacy compared with pemetrexed/ cisplatin. Gemcitabin would be an adequate maintenance therapy after  a platinum/gemcitabin doublet therapy in the absence of disease progression. Bevacizumab  blocks the vascular endothelial growth factor and is a recommended option
    for fit patients  (WHO/ECOG stage 0–1) with non-squamous cell carcinoma who are EGFR mutation negative.  Bevacizumab is not a recommended treatment for squamous cell carcinoma.

  input: A 59-year-old, overweight man suffers from newly diagnosed OSAS with daytime sleepiness. Based on randomised trials, which of the following benefits can treatment of his OSAS be expected  to provide?
  options:
  - Prolonged survival
  - Enhanced quality of life
  - Reduced daytime sleepiness
  - Reduced risk of early-onset dementia
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Studies of CPAP therapy for OSAS have shown positive effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular risk; however, no controlled trial has shown a survival benefit and for ethical reasons  this kind of study will also not be feasible in the future. Sleepiness and quality of life have  been shown to improve with CPAP in several randomised controlled trials. Although OSAS may  impair cognitive function, its treatment has not been shown to reduce the risk for early-onset  dementia.

  input: Which lung cancer cell type is most commonly associated with paraneoplastic hypercalcaemia?
  options:
  - Adenocarcinoma
  - Adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth
  - Large cell carcinoma
  - Small cell carcinoma
  - Squamous cell carcinoma
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Paraneoplastic syndromes are signs or symptoms that occur as a result of organ or tissue damage at locations remote from the site of the primary tumour or metastases. The two most common paraneoplastic syndromes associated with lung cancer are humoral hypercalcaemia in  squamous cell carcinoma and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in  small cell lung cancer. The majority of humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy cases are caused  by the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related protein (PTHrP) from the tumour. PTHrP  has significant homology with PTH in the amino-terminal region, and both PTH and PTHrP  bind to a common PTH/PTHrP receptor. Rare cases of hypercalcaemia with ectopic PTH secretion by lung cancers have also been reported. Another mechanism of humoral hypercalcaemia  of malignancy may be mediated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Long-term  exposure to G-CSF results in the stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption or
    an increase in  osteoclast progenitors. Ectopic hormone production is uncommon in large cell carcinomas.

She is an ex-smoker (she quit smoking 15 years ago) with a  20 pack-year smoking history. Approximately 1 year ago she began to notice shortness of breath  on exertion. She was initially seen by her family doctor and prescribed bronchodilators, with no clear improvement. When her symptoms got worse, with fatigue and dizziness in addition to shortness of breath  during usual everyday activities such as shopping or climbing stairs, she was referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed with the following findings: estimated pulmonary  artery systolic pressure of 70 mmHg, right ventricular dilatation with hypokinesis. Normal left ventricular size and function, with an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following examinations should be included in the further diagnostic evaluation of this  patient?'
  options:
  - Pulmonary function tests
  - HRCT of the chest
  - Ventilation/perfusion lung scan
  - Open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  rationale: "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure of  ≥25 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterisation. The recent guidelines on PH from the European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society propose a diagnostic algorithm for patients with symptoms, signs and history suggestive of PH. \nIf noninvasive assessment is compatible with PH, clinical history, symptoms, signs, ECG, chest radiograph, transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests and HRCT of the chest are requested to evaluate the presence of group 2 (left heart diseases) or group 3 (lung diseases) PH. If these are not found or if PH seems ‘out of proportion’ to their severity, less common causes of PH should be looked for. Ventilation/perfusion lung scan should be considered.  Multiple segmental perfusion defects would be consistent with the diagnosis of group 4 chronic   thro mboembolic pulmonary hypertention (CTEPH). The final diagnosis\
    \ of CTEPH would require  a CT pulmonary angiography, right heart catheterisation and selective pulmonary angiography.  If a ventilation/perfusion scan is normal or shows only subsegmental ‘patchy’ perfusion defects,  a tentative diagnosis of group 1 PH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) or the rarer conditions  (group 5 PH) is made. Additional specific diagnostic tests including haematology, biochemistry,  immunology, serology and ultrasonography will allow the final diagnosis to be refined. Open or  thoracoscopic lung biopsy entails substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. Because of the low  likelihood of altering the diagnosis and treatment, routine biopsy is discouraged in patients with  suspected pulmonary arterial hypertension."

  input: A 47-year-old clothes salesman presents with dyspnoea on exertion that has developed over the  past 6 months. He is a current smoker with a smoking history of 30 pack-years. He receives an  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor for hypertension and occasionally takes ibuprofen for  joint pains. He has no history of relevant exposure to environmental toxins or dust. His physical  examination reveals bilateral, basal, fine, end-inspiratory crackles of Velcro type and clubbing of  the fingers. His SpO2 on room air is 95%, but falls to 82% during a 6-min walk test. Spirometry  shows a FEV1 of 74% predicted, a FVC of 68% predicted and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 88%. TLCO is 42%  predicted. A recent HRCT scan of the chest shows bilateral reticular opacities with honeycombing,  predominantly in the periphery of the lung bases. Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step?
  options:
  - Positron emission tomography scan
  - Serum levels of surfactant proteins A and D
  - Video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy
  - Transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage
  - Laboratory tests for connective tissue diseases
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: This patient has a history, physical examination, pulmonary function tests and radiological  features strongly suggestive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, i.e. clubbing, Velcro rales, diffuse  parenchymal lung disease with lower lobe predominance and honeycombing in the absence of  clear features suggestive of other specific lung diseases. In such patients, especially in those  aged <50 years and with a history of arthritis, the presence of connective tissue disorders such as  scleroderma, dermatomyositis and chronic polyarthritis should be evaluated by clinical examination and laboratory tests. Laboratory tests should include rheumatoid factors, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, and anti-nuclear antibody titre and pattern. Bronchoalveolar lavage is not  necessary for the diagnosis but may be indicated to search for infection if clinically suspected.  Bronchoalveolar lavage may also give a diagnostic hint if exposure to organic dust or drugs (such  as amiodarone, for example)
    suggests possible subacute or chronic hypersenstivitiy pneumonia.  In this case, pronounced lymphocytosis may be present. Surgical biopsies are not necessary  for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in this typical presentation but may help to  differentiate usual interstitial pneumonitis from other forms of interstitial pneumonitis in less  characteristic cases. Transbronchial biopsies may show histological features of usual interstitial pneumonitis but the sensitivity and specificity of this approach for the diagnosis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is insufficient. Serum biomarkers such as surfactant protein A and D  or matrix metalloproteinase may be correlated with disease progression and prognosis but there  is not enough evidence to advocate their use in clinical patient management. Positron emission  tomography has no role in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary fibrosis unless  there is concomitant cancer that requires staging.

  input: Which of the following statements about central sleep apnoea, Cheyne–Stokes respiration and periodic breathing is/are correct?
  options:
  - Circulatory delay contributes to the development of Cheyne–Stokes respiration.
  - In Cheyne–Stokes respiration, during sleep, PaCO2 transiently falls below the critical PaCO2  required for respiratory rhythm generation.
  - Periodic breathing at altitude is associated with a low PaCO2.
  - Cheyne–Stokes respiration can trigger sympathetic nervous activation and, thereby, exert a  secondary deleterious effect on the underlying cardiac disorder.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Cheyne–Stokes respiration is a form of periodic breathing consisting of a waxing and waning  pattern of hyperpnoea alternating with central apnoea. Factors contributing to the hyperpnoea  or hyperventilation include pulmonary congestion in heart failure, increased chemosensitivity  and recurrent arousals from sleep. Central apnoea occurs when carbon dioxide tension is driven  below the apnoeic threshold. Ventilatory control in chronic heart failure is disrupted further  by circulatory delay in low cardiac output states. Excessive sympathetic outflow complicates  Cheyne–Stokes respiration, and is caused by recurrent hypoxia and respiratory arousals. This  sympathetic overactivity may exacerbate the decline in cardiac function. At altitude, hypoxia stimulates ventilation resulting in hypocapnia and a periodic pattern of  breathing.

  input: A 39-year-old female presents with painful erythema nodosum. Her physical examination  is unremarkable and her SpO2 on room air is 98%. Her chest radiograph shows bilateral hilar   lymphadenopathy. Spirometry reveals an FEV1 of 79% predicted, an FVC of 89% predicted and an  FEV1/FVC ratio of 77%, with a TLCO of 82% predicted. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?
  options:
  - A lymph node biopsy
  - Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage
  - A biopsy from the skin lesions
  - Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
  - Treatment with systemic corticosteroids
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: This patient has a clinical presentation highly suggestive of acute sarcoidosis with Löfgren’s  syndrome. The syndrome typically occurs in women and includes erythema nodosum, bilateral  hilar lymphadenopathy, migratory polyarthralgias and fever. The prognosis is good and spontaneous remissions commonly occur. Biopsy confirmation revealing noncaseating granulomas  is usually not necessary in this condition. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage revealing  an elevated lymphocyte count with a CD4/CD8 ratio >3.5 may be indicative of a diagnosis of  sarcoidosis, but again is not necessary in this patient. Biopsies from erythema nodosum skin  lesions do not provide evidence of noncaseating granulomas and are not recommended in the  context of suspected sarcoidosis. Inhaled corticosteroids may help for the suppression of cough  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may relieve her from the painful lesions of erythema  nodosum. No other treatment is indicated in this patient
    with mildly impaired lung function.

She is compliant to her medication and her inhalation technique  is correct. 2 weeks ago, she was prescribed prednisone tablets 40 mg per day for 5 days and her  inhalation therapy was intensified by increasing the dose of budesonide/formoterol 200/6 ng from  two to eight inhalations per day. Currently, she feels well. Her dyspnoea and cough have completely  disappeared and she is not impaired in her usual daily activities as a nurse. Her current peak flow  values are near her personal best of 420 L⋅min−1. Her FEV1 has increased from 48% predicted  2 weeks ago to 98% predicted now. What is the recommended next step?
  options:
  - Reduce budesonide/formoterol to two inhalations per day now.
  - Continue budesonide/formoterol at eight inhalations per day.
  - Reduce budesonide/formoterol to four inhalations per day.
  - Reduce budesonide/formoterol to four inhalations per day in 2 months.
  - Reduce budesonide/formoterol to two inhalations daily in 2 months.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: 'According to the Global Initiative for Asthma, asthma is managed by stepwise therapy in which  the dose of medication, the number of medications and/or the frequency of administration  are increased as necessary and decreased when possible. Asthma control is thereby assessed  irrespectively of medication use, based on the current level of symptoms, FEV1 or peak expiratory flow values, and number of exacerbations requiring oral glucocorticoids per year. The goal  of asthma therapy is the freedom from frequent or troublesome symptoms of asthma (cough,  chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath) and the prevention of exacerbations. It should  thus encompass: • Minimal need (≤2 days per week) of inhaled short-acting β-agonists to relieve symptoms. • Few night-time awakenings (fewer than two nights per month) due to asthma • Optimisation of lung function • Maintenance of normal daily activities, including work or school attendance, and participation in athletics and exercise
    • Satisfaction with asthma care on the part of patients and families This patient has unstable asthma as she just recently had an exacerbation without obvious  cause. Her inhalation is correct and her compliance to using her medication is good. Therefore,  after the short-term use of very high doses of budesonide/formoterol, her medications should  be reduced to lower doses but it should be higher than the previous maintenance dose, i.e.  increased from two to four inhalations per day, for at least 2–3 months.'

  input: Which of the following statements concerning pleural effusion is/are true?
  options:
  - Pulmonary embolism may cause exudative or transudative pleural effusions.
  - Benign asbestos pleural effusions are transudates.
  - Effusions after coronary bypass surgery are most frequently bilateral.
  - Pleural effusions due to pancreatitis are typically right sided.
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: 'Pleural effusion is an indicator of an underlying disease process that may be pulmonary or nonpulmonary in origin and may be acute or chronic. Pleural effusions are generally classified as  transudates or exudates based on the mechanism of fluid formation and pleural fluid chemistry.  Transudates result from an imbalance in oncotic and hydrostatic pressures, whereas exudates  are the result of inflammation of the pleura or decreased lymphatic drainage. The fluid is considered an exudate if any of the following are found: 1) Ratio of pleural fluid to  serum protein >0.5; 2) ratio of pleural fluid to serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >0.6; and  3) pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds the upper limit of the normal serum value. The fluid  is considered a transudate if all of these are absent.  Pulmonary embolism is the fourth leading cause of pleural effusion. The mechanism is usually increased interstitial fluid in the lungs as a result of ischaemia or the release of vasoactive  cytokines.
    Pleural effusion resulting from a pulmonary embolism usually occupies less than  one-third of the hemithorax. Pleural fluid caused by pulmonary emboli is usually exudative but  occasionally transudative. The most common pathological pulmonary response to asbestos inhalation is the development  of pleural plaques. Over time, collagen is deposited in the pleura and may calcify. Most plaques  are completely asymptomatic. Benign asbestos pleural effusions, which are usually unilateral, are  the most common manifestation of asbestos-related pleural disease within 10–20 years after  exposure. Asbestos pleural effusions are usually exudative. However, in cases of exudative pleural  effusions, a pleural biopsy may be needed to test for tuberculosis and malignancy. Furthermore,  pleural effusion with pleuritic pain may be a manifestation of malignant mesothelioma. Pleural effusions significant enough to require drainage develop in 6–7% of patients who  undergo coronary artery bypass grafting
    with or without valve surgery. Pleural effusion is more  frequent in women and in patients with heart failure, peripheral vascular disease or atrial  fibrillation. The pleural effusions are usually unilateral, exudative according to Light’s criteria  and, in 50% of cases, are haemorrhagic. Pleural fluid from effusions occurring >15 days postoperatively are predominantly lymphocytic, whereas earlier effusions are primarily neutrophilic. Abnormal chest radiographic findings can be seen in up to 55% of patients with acute pancreatitis and include pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary oedema-related to  acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pleural effusion has been reported in 4–20% of pancreatitis patients and is considered an indication of severe pancreatitis, not just a marker of the  disease. Pleural effusions in acute pancreatitis are usually small, occasionally bloody and are  characterised by high amylase (up to 30 times greater than corresponding serum value), protein  (>30
    g⋅L−1) and LDH (>0.6 times the serum value) levels. The majority of pleural effusions (68%)  are left sided, 22% are bilateral and only 10% are right sided. Two main causes of pleural effusion are transdiaphragmatic lymphatic blockage or pancreatic–pleural fistulae secondary to leak  and disruption of the pancreatic duct or pseudocyst caused by an episode of acute pancreatitis.'

  input: A 64-year-old alcoholic has jaundice and minimal ascites. He reports that he has smoked an average of one pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years. His total serum bilirubin is 240 mmol⋅L−1 (normal  range 3–26 mmol⋅L−1). His arterial blood gas values are PaO2 4.9 kPa (37 mmHg), PaCO2 4.2 kPa  (32 mmHg) and pH 7.45. He is given nasal oxygen at a flow rate of 4 L⋅min−1, and a repeat blood  gas reveals PaO2 5.8 kPa (44 mmHg), PaCO2 4.6 kPa (35 mmHg) and pH 7.43. Spirometry and chest  radiography are normal. To which one of the following is the hypoxaemia is most likely due?
  options:
  - Ascites and hepatomegaly causing poor gas exchange at the lung bases
  - Unrecognised subpulmonic effusion
  - Pulmonary arteriovenous shunts
  - Unrecognised microatelectasis
  - Pulmonary hypertension
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined by the triad of liver disease, impaired oxygenation  and intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunts, referred to as intrapulmonary vascular dilatations.  Impaired oxygenation is due to right-to-left shunting through these vascular dilatations. Severe  hypoxaemia (PaO2 <6.7 kPa (<50 mmHg)) that is not corrected by oxygen supplementation in  the presence of normal spirometry and chest radiography is strongly suggestive of hepatopulmonary syndrome. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography is the method of choice to confirm  the presence of intrapulmonary shunt but technetium-labelled macroaggregated albumin  nuclear scanning or pulmonary angiography can also be used. Massive ascites and hepatomegaly, subpulmonic effusion, and microatelectasis are associated  with a milder degree of hypoxaemia that improves with oxygen supplementation. In addition,  a large pleural effusion and/or atelectasis that would induce severe hypoxaemia will be associated with a significant
    loss of lung volume and radiographic abnormalities. Pulmonary hypertension secondary to liver disease might be associated with normal lung volumes and a normal  chest radiograph but with only mild hypoxaemia that aggravates during exercise.

  input: A 45-year-old man was discharged from the hospital 6 weeks ago after an asthma attack that had  required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He is now in your office for a follow-up examination. He reports being free of symptoms and he is in good general condition. Pulmonary auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1 of 75% predicted; on hospital discharge,  his FEV1 was 96% predicted. You obtain additional information during the consultation. Which of the following suggest(s) that the patient is at risk of a fatal asthma attack?
  options:
  - Allergy to sea food
  - Emergency room treatment for asthma 8 months ago
  - Discontinuation of inhaled steroids 5 days ago
  - Lack of a written asthma plan
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Asthma mortality peaked in the 1990s and although the mortality rate has declined continuously since then, 6–23 patients per million of the population still die from asthma. The most relevant risk factors are a history of poorly controlled asthma and prior near-fatal asthma attacks.  Minor risk factors include illicit drug abuse, psychosocial problems and socioeconomic factors.  The increased death rate in African Americans is not explained by racial differences but by lower  socioeconomic status.

  input: A 72-year-old male smoker with COPD was admitted to the hospital 2 days ago with a patchy right  lower lobe pneumonia accompanied by fever, increased cough and dyspnoea. A sputum Gram stain  showed Gram-positive cocci in pairs. He required oxygen (2 L⋅min−1) and was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. Now, on the third day in the hospital, he is afebrile (for the past 24 h), has good  oral intake, has no cough or sputum, and is not short of breath or tachypnoeic. His oxygen saturation on room air is 94%. A repeat chest radiograph shows a slight increase in the size of his right  lower lobe infiltrate compared to his admission chest radiograph.  What is the best clinical approach in the management of this patient?
  options:
  - Order a CT scan of the chest
  - Continue i.v. ceftriaxone
  - Change therapy to i.v. erythromycin and imipenem
  - Switch to oral therapy with amoxicillin
  - Order bronchoscopy
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: 'This patient has COPD and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The Gram stain indicates  that the patient is infected by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most likely infective organism in the described setting. Considering the fact that the patient improves clinically on the  described monotherapy with i.v. ceftriaxone and is able to take oral medication on the third  day of his hospitalisation, there is no need to continue i.v. ceftriaxone. S. pneumoniae is usually  susceptible to amoxicillin but this depends on the regional resistance pattern. It should be noted  that there is no need for a chest radiograph to be repeated prior to discharge in those who have  made a satisfactory clinical recovery. Pneumococcal urine antigen testing is recommended for  patients with moderate or high severity CAP. A CT scan is not expected to give any further information at this point, as radiological resolution  often lags behind clinical improvement from CAP. The patient improved clinically
    and there is no contraindication to oral therapy. The following  features indicate a response to initial empirical parenteral therapy permitting consideration of  oral antibiotic substitution according to the 2009 British Thoracic Society guidelines: resolution  of fever for >24 h; pulse rate <100 beats per min; resolution of tachypnoea; the patient is clinically hydrated and taking oral fluids; resolution of hypotension; absence of hypoxia; improvement in white cell count; nonbacteraemic infection; no microbiological evidence of Legionella,  staphylococcal or Gram-negative enteric bacilli infection; and no concerns over gastrointestinal  absorption. There is no indication for a broader empiric antibiotic therapy with impenem. The combination  with erythromycin offers no clinical benefit in an empiric therapy. There is no need for bronchoscopy for inspection or to obtain bacterial samples. Even if the  patient would not have improved clinically after 4 days, there should be a careful
    review of clinical history, examination, prescription chart and results of all available investigations. Further  investigations include ordering a repeat chest radiograph, C-reactive protein and white cell  count, and repeated sputum sampling before considering other tests.'

  input: A 58-year-old male hospitalised with a hip fracture for 1 week complains about shortness of breath,  fever and cough with purulent sputum production for the past 2 days. He is a nonsmoker with a history of hypertension. The patient is in good clinical condition and in moderate respiratory distress.  Vital signs are blood pressure 130/60 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per min, breath rate 30 breaths  per min and temperature 37.9 °C. Rales in the upright seated position and bronchial breath sounds  are revealed on auscultation on the left chest posteriorly. A complete blood count shows a white  blood cell count of 17 000 × 109 cells per L with 78% mature neutrophils, haematocrit 38%, creatinine 90 μmol⋅L−1 and oxygen saturation on room air is 93%. A chest radiograph confirms left lower  lobe pneumonia. The patient has not been on any antimicrobial therapy until now. Which one of the following is the appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for this patient?
  options:
  - Third generation cephalosporin plus azithromycin
  - Ertapenem as monotherapy
  - β-lactam (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus a fluoroquinolone
  - Anti-pseudomonal β-lactam (cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam) plus either ciprofloxacin or  levofloxacin
  - Aminopenicillin plus β-lactamase inhibitor plus aminoglycoside
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The patient suffers from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP, acquired within 7 days of a hospital stay). The incidence of HAP is 0.5–2.0% among all hospitalised patients and it is the second  most common nosocomial infection, but the first in terms of mortality (30–70%). The outcome  of HAP clearly depends on the adequacy of initial antimicrobial treatment. Initial antimicrobial  treatment almost always has to be started empirically. Adequate initial empirical antimicrobial  treatment crucially depends on the identification of essential risk factors for distinct pathogens.  Three fundamental determinants for particular pathogen spectrums have been recognised. 1. Pneumonia of the spontaneously breathing or the ventilated patient. The available data  indicates that in spontaneously breathing patients potentially drug-resistant microorganisms play a minor role. 2. Time course of development of pneumonia (early versus late). The expected pathogens in  early-onset pneumonia (onset
    ≤4 days after hospital admission) include Staphylococcus  aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and non-drug-resistant Gramnegative bacteria (GNEB). In late-onset pneumonia (onset >4 days after hospital admission)  principal pathogens include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), drug-resistant  GNEB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and other potentially drug-resistant  microorganisms. 3. Presence of defined risk factors. These include age, structural lung disease, previous antimicrobial treatment, prior tracheobronchial colonisation (mainly as a result of comorbidity  and previous antimicrobial treatment). In patients with late-onset HAP (as the patient in this question) or at risk for P. aeruginosa, initial  treatment should preferably be a combination treatment of anti-pseudomonas β-lactams or carbapenems and an anti-pseudomonal quinolone. In the absence of other alternatives, increased  resistance rates to quinolones and concerns
    about the adverse effects of increased quinolone  use, aminogylcosides should still be considered as an additional suitable choice.

  input: Which of the following statement(s) is/are true regarding pleural effusion?
  options:
  - Hepatic hydrothorax is more often located in the left hemithorax than in the right.
  - In a chylothorax, the chylous fluid typically has a low triglyceride and a high cholesterol  concentration.
  - Eosinophils are compatible with previous blood or air entering the pleural space.
  - A ratio of lymphocytes/polymorphonuclear cells of >0.3 makes tuberculous pleurisy unlikely.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Hepatic hydrothorax is most commonly located on the right side. Chylous fluid contains high  concentrations of triglycerides. Eosinophilic pleural effusions, defined as ≥10% eosinophils,  may be caused by many conditions. Eosinophilic pleural effusion occurs most commonly with  the presence of blood or air in the pleural space, infections and malignancy. Drug-induced pleural effusions, pleural effusions accompanying pulmonary embolism and benign asbestos pleural  effusions are also common causes of eosinophilic pleural effusion. No aetiology is identified in  as many as one-third of patients. Pleural effusions of tuberculous origin are mostly mononuclear predominant, with a mononuclear/polymorphonuclear cell ratio of >0.75 in almost 90%  of cases.

  input: A 62-year-old male presents to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath and chest  pressure. He was discharged from the hospital 5 days ago after a haemorrhagic stroke. His past  medical history includes hypertension, obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea. On physical examination, the patient’s heart rate is 98 beats per min, blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, respiratory  rate is 24 breaths per min and SpO2 is 86% on room air. Laboratory analyses, including a complete  blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, cardiac enzymes and coagulation studies are normal. An ECG  shows sinus tachycardia with an incomplete right bundle branch block and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. Echocardiography reveals an estimated pulmonary artery pressure of 60 mmHg, tricuspid  regurgitation and right atrial and ventricular enlargement. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE)  is made, based on CT pulmonary angiogram of the chest, which reveals multiple thrombi extending  into the lobar and
    segmental branches of the right pulmonary artery. In addition the CT scan reveals  thrombi in the pelvic veins. Which of the following is the best management option for this patient?
  options:
  - Surgical pulmonary embolectomy
  - Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)
  - Anticoagulant treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux
  - Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion
  - Compression stocking
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: PE is a relatively common condition that affects all age groups and is potentially lethal. Early  diagnosis is crucial, since immediate treatment is highly effective. An important issue is to  assess the severity of the suspected or confirmed PE. PE can be stratified into several levels of  risk of early death, based on the presence of risk markers. Immediate bedside clinical assessment for the presence or absence of clinical markers such as shock or hypotension allows stratification into high-risk and non-high-risk PE. This classification helps in the choice of the initial  management. This patient, according to his vital signs, must be classified in the non-high-risk  group of suspected PE. Several therapeutic strategies are available for the treatment of PE, with anticoagulants the  main therapy for acute PE. The main objectives of therapy in the treatment of PE are to prevent  thrombus extension and recurrences of venous thromboembolism. Thrombolytic therapy should be used
    in patients with high-risk PE presenting with cardiogenic  shock and/or persistent arterial hypotension. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy is a recommended therapeutic alternative in patients with high-risk PE in whom thrombolysis is absolutely contraindicated or has failed. Routine use of thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy in  non-high-risk PE patients is not recommended. This patient with non-high-risk PE and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulant therapy  (haemorrhagic stroke) must be treated with IVC filter insertion. IVC filter is indicated only in  patients with acute venous thromboembolism who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulant therapy (e.g. recent surgery, haemorrhagic stroke, significant active or recent bleeding) and in those who have objectively documented recurrent venous thromboembolism despite  adequate anticoagulant therapy. Use of LMWH or fondaparinux is the recommended form of initial treatment for most patients  with non-high-risk PE, in the absence
    of contraindication to anticoagulant therapy.

  input: 'A 25-year-old, previously healthy woman is referred to the emergency department of your hospital  because of shortness of breath, fever and chills. She reports that she has had flu-like symptoms  and fever of 39.9°C in the previous week. After 3 days, she felt better and the fever diminished.  Today, she suddenly felt worse again, and had high fever, chills and shortness of breath. On physical examination she looks ill but is well oriented. Her respiratory rate is 32 breaths per min, heart  rate 110 beats per min and blood pressure 100/55 mmHg. Auscultation reveals bronchial breath  sounds and rales in the right hemithorax. Chest radiography reveals a lobar infiltrate in the left upper  lobe. Her laboratory results are as follows: erythrocyte sedimentation rate 135 mm⋅h−1, C-reactive  protein 350 mg⋅L−1, leukocytes 19 000 cells per μL, urea 10.0 mmol⋅L−1, creatinine 110 mmol⋅L−1,  sodium 135 mmol⋅L−1, potassium 4.0 mmol⋅L−1 and Hb 112 g⋅L−1.

  options:
  - Treat her as an outpatient with empiric antibiotics if she has family support.
  - Admit her to a general ward and start empiric antibiotics.
  - Admit her to a general ward and start antibiotics according to blood culture results.
  - Admit her to the intensive care unit, and start empiric antibiotics and supplemental oxygen.
  - Admit her to the intensive care unit, and start empiric antibiotics and NIV.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: This patient has community-acquired pneumonia, based on the presence of an acute illness  with cough, new focal signs in the chest, an infiltrate in the chest radiograph and fever for  >4 days. The illness is severe, according to the CURB score of 3, on the basis of blood pressure,  urea and respiratory frequency. Mortality in such patients is 17%. Furthermore, the patient  has acute respiratory failure with severe gas exchange impairment. This justifies admission to  an intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate care unit. The definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not fulfilled, although she has severe gas exchange impairment (PaO2/ inspiratory oxygen fraction is 6.8/0.21=32.4 kPa (243 mmHg)). According to the Berlin definition, the diagnosis requires bilateral opacities on chest imaging, exclusion of cardiac failure by  objective means and impaired oxygenation with a positive end-expiratory pressure >5 cmH2O. The blood gas analysis was carried out on room
    air and giving supplemental oxygen is the first  step before intubating the patient or putting her on NIV. As oxygen administration alone might  not be sufficient, ICU admission is appropriate. Because assisted mechanical ventilation may be  required at a later stage, monitoring the patient in the ICU is appropriate.

  input: A 56-year-old missionary nun returns from Vietnam. She has been in the country for 6 months  travelling among local communities. She has a cough, with some blood-streaked sputum, and she  reports some breathlessness. She has no fever. Chest radiography shows a pleural effusion and  cavitating lesions in the mid-zone on the same side as the pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows  an exudative pleural fluid and a low glucose concentration, and a differential cell count shows that  the fluid contains >10% eosinophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
  options:
  - Actinomycosis
  - Tuberculosis
  - Streptococcal infection
  - Paragonimiasis
  - Lung cancer
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: 'Paragonimiasis is caused by inflammation and fibrosis due to worms in the lung. The clinical  presentation depends on the duration of infection. Although the patient may experience some  malaise, fever is generally not a feature. The patient often does not feel or appear ill despite the  recurrent haemoptysis. Blood eosinophilia is often absent. Generally, one or more lesions at the  sites of localised encysted flukes or their burrowing tracts are recognised on chest radiography.  When abnormalities are visible on chest radiograph or CT, one or more of the following may be  seen: ring shadow lesions resulting from the relative lucency of the contents of the cystic cavities; or parenchymal mass lesions. The pulmonary lesions are often mistaken for tuberculosis,  particularly as the two diseases are often co-endemic. The lesions of paragonimiasis generally  are more peripherally located and much more common in the mid- and lower lung zones, as  opposed to the predominantly apical
    location of tuberculous cavities. Eosinophilia is not a typical feature of streptococcal infection or tuberculosis and streptococcal disease typically causes  fever. A lung cancer, in particular of the squamous cell type, may cause cavitation, but eosinophilia would not be expected.'

  input: A 21-year-old man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy suffers from chronic alveolar hypoventilation. He is on 24-h NIV using a portable bilevel positive airway pressure ventilator operated in the  spontaneous/timed mode. During a routine follow-up, you perform arterial blood gas analysis,  which reveals an elevated PaCO2. Analysis of data stored in the ventilator memory shows that 90%  of breaths are patient-triggered. Which of the following measures would be most likely to reduce hypercapnia?
  options:
  - Supplemental oxygen
  - Increasing expiratory positive airway pressure
  - Increasing water vapour pressure (humidification)
  - Increasing inspiratory positive airway pressure
  - Reducing respiratory rate
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The cause of hypercapnia in this case of neuromuscular disease with respiratory muscle weakness is alveolar hypoventilation. In order to increase alveolar ventilation, increased ventilatory  support is required, which can be achieved by an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure. This will increase tidal volume and, hence, V´E. Applying supplemental oxygen might even  worsen hypercapnia by reducing the hypoxic ventilatory drive and subsequently reducing the  breath rate, which is triggered by the patient in the spontaneous/timed mode. By increasing the  expiratory positive airway pressure, the pressure amplitude between inspiration and expiration,  and therefore the tidal volume, would decrease, so the hypercapnia would worsen. Reducing  the back-up respiratory rate will have no effect as the patient is breathing at a higher rate than  the selected back-up rate (90% of breaths are patient triggered). Humidification has no effect  on alveolar ventilation and is therefore
    not an effective measure to reduce hypercapnia.

  input: One of the passengers on a flight from New York to Brussels was discovered to have multidrugresistant (MDR) tuberculosis after she arrived in Brussels. 2 weeks later you are consulted by one  of the passengers who had been on the same flight and had been informed that she should seek  medical advice. That passenger is otherwise healthy, and recent HIV and tuberculin tests were  negative. Which one of the following management options would be most appropriate?
  options:
  - Immediate chest radiograph
  - Tuberculin test or interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) in 6 weeks
  - Prophylactic chemotherapy similar to that prescribed to the patient in the USA
  - Treatment only if the tuberculin test or IGRA is positive
  - Chest radiograph in 6 weeks
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: 2 weeks after contact, a chest radiograph would be unhelpful as the infection at contact would  not have manifested yet. A positive tuberculin test or IGRA may indicate latent tuberculosis (TB)  infection and a chest radiograph should only be performed after a positive result is obtained.  Preventive anti-TB chemotherapy is not indicated for infection with MDR-TB because there is  no evidence that it will be effective and because only a small proportion of infected contacts will  develop TB. Contacts who test positively should be actively followed up for >2 years. Whether  patients at elevated risk for developing active TB (such as HIV-infected patients) should receive  preventive treatment for latent MDR-TB infection is currently unknown.

  input: Which one of the following statements about aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is correct?
  options:
  - It is more prevalent in men than women.
  - It is generally atopic.
  - It is more often severe than other forms of asthma.
  - It is rarely associated with rhinosinusitis.
  - It disappears in most patients with advancing age.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is an aggressive mucosal non-immunoallergic  inflammatory disease combined with precipitation of asthma and rhinitis attacks that occurs  after ingestion of aspirin and most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If clinical  diagnosis is uncertain, the diagnosis can be confirmed by an aspirin challenge in a specialised  centre. Up to 28% of adults with asthma suffer from exacerbations in response to aspirin and other  NSAIDs. AERD is more common in severe asthma. Women are affected 2.5 times more often  than men. Symptoms may include vasomotor rhinitis and profuse rhinorrhoea, chronic nasal  congestion evolves, and physical examination often reveals nasal polyps. Once aspirin or NSAID  hypersensitivity develops, it is present for life if desensitisation is not performed. Patients with  AERD should avoid aspirin and other NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. If required,  patients may use a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib)
    or paracetamol. Desensitisation may improve  symptoms and quality of life, and reduce formation of nasal polyps.

  input: A 35-year-old female patient, suffering from asthma since childhood, receives budesonide/ formoterol  (200/6 μg) combination treatment (two inhalations twice daily), and montelukast once daily. The  patient has no nocturnal symptoms, nor does she report any limitation of activities. However, she  uses salbutamol for relief three times weekly, her FEV1 is 70% predicted and she has received  three courses of oral steroids in the past year. Her IgE levels have been 150–250 kU⋅L−1 over the  course of the past 3 months. Which one of the following statements is correct regarding her management?
  options:
  - No change in treatment is justified.
  - Anti-IgE treatment should be instituted.
  - Triggering factors should be investigated and a step up of treatment is required.
  - The dose of the combination given to the patient is very high and must be lowered.
  - Long-term low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: This patient has uncontrolled asthma based on oral steroid courses and salbutamol use more  than twice weekly, even if she does not report symptoms or limitations. Therefore a step up in  treatment is required. The patient has moderately elevated IgE levels. Triggering factors and  her allergic background should be examined. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy  states that anti-IgE is a treatment option limited to patients with elevated serum levels of IgE  (i.e. >100 kU⋅L−1) and that for allergic patients, with an elevated IgE, not controlled on highdose inhaled glucocorticosteroids and a long acting β2-agonist and who continue to have exacerbations, a trial of omalizumab can be considered. Therefore the inhaled steroid should be  increased to a high dose first. The patient’s budesonide dose is moderate (800 μg per day). According to the GINA strategy,  high doses of budesonide for adults are considered to be more than 800 μg per day. The patient  should be treated
    according to step four of the GINA treatment steps. However, before stepping  up the treatment to step four it is advisable to increase inhaled corticosteroids to a high dose  and try sustained-release theophylline.

  input: A 52-year-old man, who is a teacher and a nonsmoker, complains of a dry cough that he has had  for the past 8 months. Within the past 3 months, he has felt some shortness of breath. He has  been previously healthy and does not take any medication. Detailed history does not suggest any  occupational or environmental risk factors. Fine crackles (velcro) can be heard over both lung. There  is no clubbing. CT of the lung shows an extensive, bilateral ground-glass pattern together with  reticular opacities, especially in the periphery. There is no honeycombing or lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial pneumonia type)
  - Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis
  - Cryptogenic organising pneumonia
  - Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease
  - Sarcoidosis
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The described case shows the typical presentation of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis  (NSIP). Men and women in their 50s and 60s are affected equally, and show a slow progression  of cough and dyspnoea. Careful assessment of the patient’s history fails to identify any cause of  his interstitial lung disease, such as occupational or environmental exposures, drugs, or autoimmune disease. While idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis of the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) type typically presents with progressive dyspnoea and cough, the UIP pattern on CT includes lower lobe and  subpleural predominant fibrosis with patchy involvement of the lung parenchyma. Areas of little or no involvement typically alternate with parenchyma showing scarring and honeycombing. Traction bronchiectasis can be seen with progressive disease. UIP shows less ground-glass  opacity than reticulation. Although we cannot completely exclude an early UIP, it is less likely  than NSIP. Cryptogenic organising pneumonia
    presents with patchy bilateral consolidation, sometimes  associated with perifocal ground-glass opacities. The consolidations typically vary over time;  disappear in one location and emerge in others. Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) is a typical disease of  smokers with an average exposure of >30 pack-years. Radiologically, RB-ILD features bronchial  wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, patchy ground-glass opacities and areas with low attenuation levels due to air trapping. Pulmonary sarcoidosis typically presents with cough, dyspnoea and chest pain. However,  crackles are not commonly heard. Often, patients also complain of fatigue, malaise, fever and  weight loss. While radiological staging of sarcoidosis is assessed with a conventional chest  radiograph, HRCT often shows a variety of intrathoracic abnormalities. These include hilar and  mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and thickening and nodules along the bronchovascular bundles.  Parenchymal
    masses or nodular consolidation, ground-glass opacities and fibrosis can also be  found.

  input: A 62-year-old woman with COPD is admitted to the hospital because of fever, fatigue and severe  dyspnoea. Her nutritional status is normal but she is cyanotic and breathing at 35 breaths per  min. The clinical examination and the chest radiograph disclose a consolidation of the left lower  lobe. Because respiratory acidosis is worsening, she is admitted to the intensive care unit and  intubated. She is treated with an intravenous antibiotic, prednisone (50 mg per day) and inhaled  bronchodilators. The lung consolidation slowly resolves after 14 days but several attempts to  resume spontaneous breathing fail because of tachypnoea, unbearable dyspnoea and elevation  of PaCO2. At this point, which is the most appropriate test to identify the cause of weaning failure?
  options:
  - Body composition by bioimpedance analysis
  - Hypoxic response test
  - Hypercapnic response test
  - Electrophysiological studies of peripheral nerves and muscles
  - Muscle biopsy
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Weaning from mechanical ventilation is one of the main challenges in intensive care units.  Weaning failure is frequently associated with severe underlying disease and less-than-optimal  improvement in the underlying pulmonary condition. The weaning failure of this patient is  caused by neuromuscular weakness manifesting as tachypnoea and hypercapnia during the  weaning trial. This patient most likely suffers from critical-illness neuromyopathy; mechanical  ventilation, steroid treatment, neuromuscular blocking agents and aminoglycoside antibiotics are predisposing factors for critical-illness myopathy. An electroneuromyogram is the most  appropriate diagnostic test to identify critical-illness neuromyopathy. Hypoxic and hypercapnic response tests are used to assess ventilatory control. Muscle biopsy  is too invasive for this patient but would probably prove nonspecific changes of the myocytes  compatible with critical-illness myopathy.

  input: Regarding determination of lung volumes, which of the following statements is/are correct?
  options:
  - Functional residual capacity measured by the closed-circuit helium dilution method includes  the volume of gas within lung bullae.
  - The accuracy of the gas dilution techniques in measuring lung volumes is dependent on beginning and ending the test at the same volume.
  - Plethysmographic techniques for determining lung volumes measure the communicating and  noncommunicating intrathoracic gas volumes.
  - Plethysmographic determination of lung volumes is accurate regardless of starting volume.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Plethysmographic techniques for determining lung volumes measure the communicating and noncommunicating intrathoracic gas volumes. The helium dilution method is a way of measuring the functional residual capacity (FRC)  of the lungs (the volume left in the lungs after normal expiration). With this technique,  a closed-circuit system is used where a spirometer is filled with a mixture of helium and  oxygen. The amount of helium in the spirometer is known at the beginning of the test  (concentration × volume = amount). The patient is then asked to breathe in the mixture starting  at FRC, i.e. after a normal expiration. The helium concentration in the spirometer is measured.  The helium spreads into the lungs of the patient and is diluted until a plateau concentration is  reached. Because helium is not absorbed by the lungs to a relevant degree there is no loss of  this inert gas, and the amount of helium in the lungs and in the spirometer remains constant  during the test. From
    the known volume of the spirometer, the initial helium concentration  and the change in the helium concentration during the test, the FRC can be calculated. If the  patient is initially connected to the spirometer at a different lung volume (e.g. TLC), this will be  the measured volume. The helium dilution method measures FRC excluding the volumes of gas not properly participating in ventilation like lung areas with trapped air (bullae) or extrapulmonary air (pneumothorax).  In contrast, body plethysmography also measures the noncommunicating intrathoracic gas volumes. The volume in the lungs measured after a normal expiration is called the intrathoracic  gas volume (ITGV). In healthy subjects, ITGV = FRC. Plethysmographic determination of lung volumes is started from ITGV (after a normal expiration). The patient should be asked to breathe in and out normally. There should be no drift in the  end-expiratory lung volume, or ITGV would be measured inaccurately.

  input: Which of the following statements is/are correct concerning asbestos-related malignancies?
  options:
  - Asbestos exposure is associated with an increased incidence primarily of small cell lung cancer.
  - Asbestos exposure in cigarette smokers multiplies the risk of lung cancer.
  - The risk for developing malignant mesothelioma is independent of the history of cigarette  smoking.
  - Latency between asbestos exposure and lung cancer peaks at 10 years.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  rationale: The risk for developing malignant mesothelioma is independent of the history  of cigarette smoking. The most common type of lung cancer in cases of asbestos exposure is nonsmall cell lung   cancer. Exposure to both cigarette smoking and asbestos increases the risk of lung cancer  sig nificantly, with a synergistic effect between the two. In contrast, the risk of mesothelioma  is related only to asbestos exposure, independent of cigarette smoking. The latency period  between the initial asbestos exposure and lung malignancy is quite long, typically between 15  and 35 years.
- id: Q177
  input: During an influenza outbreak, a 35-year-old obese female, who has a history of asthma, is admitted to hospital with worsening dyspnoea associated with a cough, wheeze and phlegm. The patient  is treated for a virus-induced asthma exacerbation with intravenous corticosteroids and nebulised  bronchodilators. She makes good progress over the next 48 h, but then becomes very distressed  with rapid shallow breathing, cough and worsening arterial blood gases, and a dense bilateral consolidation. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals lymphocytosis and high granulocyte count. Gram stain  is negative. She is intubated, transferred to the intensive care unit and placed on broad-spectrum  antibiotics. Despite assisted ventilation, she continues to deteriorate over the next few hours with  severe hypoxaemia (PaO2 6.0 kPa (45 mmHg) on FIO2 1.0). Cardiac output needs to be supported  with dobutamine in order to sustain a mean arterial blood pressure of 70 mmHg. Which one of the following is the next,
    most appropriate additional treatment?
  options:
  - High-dose inhaled corticosteroids
  - Vancomycin
  - Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
  - Intra-aortic balloon pump
  - Prone ventilation
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: The mortality and morbidity of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)  remains high despite advances in intensive care practice. The low-tidal-volume ventilation strategy (ARDS-Net protocol) has been shown to be effective in improving survival. Unfortunately,  however, some patients have such severe ARDS that they cannot be managed with the ARDSNet strategy. In these patients, rescue therapies, such as high-frequency ventilation, prone  ventilation, nitric oxide and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are considered. The  CESAR (Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure) trial has shown  that an ECMO-based protocol improved survival without severe disability, compared with conventional ventilation. The recent increased incidence of severe respiratory failure due to the  H1N1 influenza pandemic has led to an increased use of ECMO. A definitive role for intravenous corticosteroids in the treatment of ARDS in adults has
    not been established and inhaled  corticosteroids are ineffective. There is no evidence in the described case of bacterial infection  warranting vancomycin. Neither of those two options would immediately improve oxygenation.  There is no reason to implant a balloon pump, since mean arterial pressure is sufficient with  dobutamine.

  input: Which of the following statements about the diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma is/are correct?
  options:
  - Negative cytology is sufficient to rule out a diagnosis in a patient with a pleural mass and a  history of asbestos exposure.
  - Fine-needle biopsy is recommended for the diagnosis if the patient is unfit for thoracoscopy.
  - Thoracoscopy is the procedure of choice for the diagnosis.
  - Immunohistochemistry is used to confirm the diagnosis.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma should not be based on cytology, as the sensitivity is poor  (∼30%). Fine-needle aspiration is not recommended unless the patient is unfit, as the sensitivity and specificity are lower than those of thoracoscopy, which is the diagnostic gold standard.  Immunohistochemistry is essential to differentiate mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma and  squamous and transitional cell carcinoma. Presently, there is no evidence that there is any  appropriate screening modality for mesothelioma. Asbestos fibres can sometimes be found,  especially if there was a high asbestos load. In rare cases, mesothelioma can develop without  asbestos exposure.

  input: A 50-year-old female nonsmoker presents to the emergency unit with severe cough and nonpurulent sputum production for 6 weeks, becoming worse in the last 3 days. She has no fever but  has lost 4 kg body weight. On bronchoscopy, adenocarcinoma positive for the marker thyroid transcription factor-1 was diagnosed in transbronchial biopsies of the left lower lobe and a right-sided  paratracheal fine-needle aspiration of a lymph node. Which of the following tests has the highest probability of being positive and may alter treatment?
  options:
  - Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene rearrangements in tissue specimens
  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation analysis in tissue specimens
  - Mucin-1 cancer antigen (CA15-3) in serum
  - Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) protein in serum
  - Neuron-specific enolase in serum
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtyping has recently become important in determining  patient management with novel drugs. The identification of distinct mutations frequently  associated with NSCLC has an increasingly important impact on lung cancer treatment. Several  molecular alterations involving various genes, such as EGFR, KRAS and ALK, seem to have  a remarkable predilection for adenocarcinoma. Specific inhibitors of EGFR and ALK are now  available for patients with adenocarcinoma harbouring the relevant gene alterations. First-line  gefitinib improves progression-free survival in patients with advanced NSCLC who are selected on  the basis of EGFR mutations. Crizotinib is superior to standard first-line pemetrexed–platinumbased chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.  However, EGFR mutations are found much more often than ALK rearrangements, including in  nonsmoking females. The need to generate increasing amounts of genomic
    information has to  be considered when planning diagnostic procedures. Serum tumour markers do not contribute  to the choice of therapy.

  input: A 45-year-old smoker is admitted to hospital after a motorcycle accident. He is otherwise in good  health and his previous history is unremarkable. A thoracoabdominal CT is performed that shows  an absence of traumatic lesions but discloses a 4-mm nodule in the left upper lobe, defined as a  solid noncalcified opacity. There is no previous radiological examination available. What is the most appropriate management strategy?
  options:
  - Follow-up low-dose CT every 3 months, up to 24 months if stable
  - Follow-up low-dose CT at 12 months, no additional follow-up if stable
  - Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging and lobectomy if positive
  - Diagnostic wedge resection
  - Transthoracic needle biopsy
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Evaluation of pulmonary nodules is based on radiological characteristics and clinical probability  of malignancy (table). Follow-up low-dose CT for a lung nodule ≤4 mm, in a high-risk patient  such as a smoker, should be performed at 12 months and, if it is stable, no additional follow-up  is required. Positron emission tomography (PET) is appropriate for the evaluation of lung nodules ≥8 mm and should be performed in patients with low to intermediate risk of lung cancer.  High-risk nodules ≥8 mm should be biopsied or excised. Nonsurgical biopsy is a choice for low  to intermediate risk lung nodules ≥8 mm with either negative or positive PET.

  input: Which of the following statements concerning occupational sensitivity to latex is/are true?
  options:
  - It causes asthma attacks.
  - It is strongly associated with atopy.
  - The most common symptom is cough.
  - The antigen cross-reacts with birch pollen.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Natural rubber latex is often found in surgical gloves, balloons and condoms. Occupational latex  sensitisation, therefore, is quite frequent among healthcare professionals. Approximately 50%  of patients with latex sensitisation are atopic. Due to the dermal sensitisation by gloves, skin  symptoms are most frequently observed. Asthma, however, also occurs as allergic reaction to  latex. More than 13 proteins have been identified as being responsible for allergic reactions.  Corn starch powder, which is used to powder the gloves, is known to increase the sensitisation  by the proteins. Banana, kiwi, avocado and tomato are known to cross-react with latex; the  same is true for birch pollen.

  input: Which one of the following statements concerning interventions aimed at promoting smoking   cessation in patients with COPD is not correct?
  options:
  - Smoking cessation interventions are successful at 1 year in >65% of patients.
  - Successful interventions improve survival.
  - Interventions should include psychosocial support and pharmacological treatment.
  - Nicotine replacement therapy may increase the success rate.
  - Varenicline is superior to psychosocial support alone.
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: At the end of a dedicated smoking cessation intervention in COPD patients, more than 50% quit  smoking. After 1 year, 20–40% still refrain from smoking. Smoking cessation in COPD patients  is more difficult than in smokers without COPD, due to common comorbidities such as depression in COPD patients. While randomised controlled trials using bronchodilators have failed  to show an improvement in mortality, trials on smoking cessation interventions have shown  an improvement. The largest study on smoking cessation in COPD to date is the Lung Health  Study, with over 5000 patients followed up for 15 years on an intention-to-treat basis. The Lung  Health Study used an intense smoking cessation programme in conjunction with a nicotine  patch. The 1-year quit rate was 40%. Varenicline has been studied to a much lesser degree  than nicotine replacement therapy. However, a recent study in patients with COPD showed that  varenicline was about twice as effective as placebo.

  input: A 53-year-old insulation worker with probable former asbestos exposure presents to the emergency  department with new-onset dyspnoea. Chest ultrasound reveals a right-sided pleural effusion. Which of the following finding(s) on a CT image would further support previous exposure to  asbestos?
  options:
  - Calcified pleural plaques
  - Pleural thickening
  - Pulmonary fibrosis
  - Partial lower lobe atelectasis (rounded atelectasis)
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Calcified pleural plaques are a typical marker of asbestos exposure, mostly not associated with  symptoms or functional impairment. In rare cases, pleural calcifications can cause slightly  restrictive pulmonary function. Benign pleural thickening is one of the well-known sequela of  asbestos exposure. Pulmonary fibrosis is a “dose-dependent” complication of asbestos exposition. Partial atelectasis, most often presenting in the lower lobes, is sometimes found in  patients previously exposed to asbestos. The mechanism of its origin is not yet completely clear.  Rounded atelectasis (otherwise known as pulmonary pseudotumour or Blesovsky’s syndrome)  is an important benign differential diagnosis for chest radiograph abnormalities that may mimic  lung cancer. It is important to consider this possibility to avoid unnecessary invasive investigation and patient anxiety.

  input: A 27-year-old female in the 22nd week of pregnancy presents to her family physician because of  recent onset of dyspnoea on moderate exertion and cough without sputum production causing  frequent nocturnal awakening. She had been treated for bronchial asthma with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-adrenergic agonists but stopped treatment at the beginning of the  pregnancy because of fear of adverse effects on the fetus. On physical examination, she is in good  general condition but lung auscultation reveals slight bilateral wheezing. Spirometry shows FVC of  90% predicted, FEV1 of 50% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%. After inhalation of two puffs of  salbutamol, FEV1 improved to 90% predicted while FVC remained 90% predicted. Which one of the following recommendations is most appropriate for this patient?
  options:
  - Stop treatment because asthma becomes less severe during pregnancy.
  - Restart inhaled corticosteroids.
  - Avoid systemic corticosteroids during pregnancy.
  - Avoid short-acting β-adrenergic agonists during pregnancy.
  - Restart long-acting β-adrenergic agonists.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Asthma is a very common respiratory disease and therefore the number of pregnant women  with asthma is also high. There is no clear trend of change in asthma control during pregnancy. However, women with asthma are strongly advised to continue their usual treatment  as before pregnancy. There is no evidence that standard asthma therapy is unsafe in pregnancy  and labour. Acute exacerbations should be managed in hospital with foetal monitoring and  with use of steroids as needed. Maternal SaO2 should be kept above 95%. During labour, it is  advisable to give 100 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours in patients who were on systemic  steroids with doses of more than 7.5 mg prednisolone for the preceding 2 weeks. Although  β-adrenergic agonists reduce uterine contraction, it is not advisable to compromise maternal  lung function during labour by withholding them. β-adrenergic blockers, prostaglandin F2 and  nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs (in sensitive subjects) should be avoided,
    since they can cause  bronchospasm.

  input: A patient with very severe COPD has an FVC of 2.7 L (60% of predicted), FEV1 of 0.8 L (25% of  predicted) and FEV1/FVC of 30%. In which of the following is a therapeutic exercise programme likely to result?
  options:
  - An increase in FEV1
  - An increase in 6-min walking distance
  - A decrease in oxygen extraction by muscles
  - and FEV1/FVC of 30%. In which of the following is a therapeutic exercise programme likely to result?
  - A decrease in resting PaCO2
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: In severe and very severe COPD patients (i.e. those with an FEV1 <50% predicted), pulmonary  rehabilitation results in improvement of health-related quality of life, dyspnoea and exercise tolerance (as measured, for example, by exercise tests, including the 6-min walk test). Pulmonary  rehabilitation has no effect on lung function (FEV1) or blood gases. Oxygen extraction by skeletal  muscles increases rather than decreases after exercise training.

  input: A 48-year-old man has had a recent onset of numbness and paraesthesia of his feet. He has an  8-year history of intermittent wheezing and shortness of breath. Physical examination reveals mild  expiratory wheezes, a skin rash consisting of small purpuric lesions over the lower extremities, and loss  of sharp/blunt distinction over the lower extremities. His chest radiograph shows mild hyperinflation  but is otherwise normal. His white blood cell count is 14 000 per μL with 7% neutrophils, 20%  eosinophils and 10% lymphocytes. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 70 mm⋅h−1. His serum  antinuclear antibody titre is 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Biopsy of a skin lesion shows necrotising  granulomatous lesions with a dense infiltrate of eosinophils and a capillaritis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Polyarteritis nodosa
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus
  - Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
  - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
  - Necrotising sarcoid granulomatosis
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: 'The symptoms and clinical findings of this patient are typical for the diagnosis of eosinophilic  granulomatosis with polyangiitis. This is a vasculitis of small vessels with variable medium-sized  vessel involvement. It often occurs in patients who suffer from late-onset asthma associated  with eosinophilia in peripheral blood and/or tissue. The American College of Rheumatology  defined the following diagnostic criteria: • Asthma • Eosinophilia (>10% eosinophils) • Neuropathy in a vasculitic pattern (e.g. mononeuritis multiplex) • Transient pulmonary infiltrates • Paranasal sinus abnormality • Extravascular eosinophilia on biopsy For classification purposes, a patient is said to have eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis if at least four out of these six criteria are positive. The typical finding in lung biopsies is  necrotising angiitis, granuloma and tissue eosinophilia. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic  antibodies are present in up to two-thirds of patients
    but also occur in many other autoimmune  and infectious diseases.'
- id: Q189
  input: Which one of the following statements about lymphangioleiomyomatosis is true?
  options:
  - A pleural effusion, if present, is usually a lymphocytic exudate.
  - The presence of kidney angiomyolipomas or lymphangioleiomyomas is necessary for the  diagnosis.
  - The risk of pneumothorax is greater in pregnancy.
  - Lung function is usually characterised by a restrictive pattern with decreased TLCO.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Pleural effusions in lymphagioleiomyomatosis (LAM) are usually chylous, commonly accompanied  by chylous ascites. The presence of kidney angiomyolipomas or lymphangioleiomyomas is not necessary for the  diagnosis of LAM in patients with compatible HRCT and/or biopsy-proven pathology compatible  with LAM, or in the presence of chylous effusions or tuberous sclerosis. The risks of pneumothorax and of chylous effusions are both increased during pregnancy and represent two of the  most important problems of patients with LAM during pregnancy. Lung function in LAM is typically characterised by airflow obstruction, combined with a reduced  diffusing capacity.

  input: A 57-year-old male with ischaemic heart disease is admitted with an episode of acute pulmonary  oedema. Assessment shows a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg, SpO2 of 89%, PaO2 7.8 kPa  (59 mmHg), PaCO2 3.5 kPa (26 mmHg) and pH of 7.34 in room air. After establishing initial therapy  with nitrates, oxygen and loop diuretics, the emergency department team request your advice on  the use of NIV or CPAP therapy. Which of the following statements regarding treatment of this patient is/are true?
  options:
  - NIV reduces breathlessness.
  - NIV is superior to CPAP in reducing mortality.
  - Intubation rate is reduced by use of NIV.
  - NIV increases the risk of acute myocardial infarction.
  correct_answer: A
  rationale: 'The evidence to support the use of CPAP and NIV is not as clear-cut in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema as it is for the use of NIV in acute hypercapnic exacerbations of COPD. Key issues  in the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema are to: 1) establish the diagnosis  by history, chest radiograph and biomarker (brain natriuretic protein) level; 2) assess severity  (blood pressure, tachycardia, jugular venous pressure, urine output and SaO2); 3) determine  cause (myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmia, acute valvular disease, deteriorating renal function,  chest infection, comorbidity, etc.); 4) preserve myocardial function; and 5) relieve symptoms.  Key medical interventions are oxygen therapy, nitrates, loop diuretics, opioids and therapy  directed to the primary cause. There have been a series of meta-analyses and systematic reviews pooling data from relatively  small studies of the use of CPAP versus standard therapy, bilevel NIV versus standard therapy  and bilevel
    NIV versus CPAP. While the pooled data suggest improvement in mortality/intubation rates with CPAP and NIV, there was no difference between these modalities and a subsequent large randomised clinical trial (3CPO) showed that while NIV produced an early reduction  in breathlessness and improvement in physiological variables, this did not translate into an  improvement in mortality. This discrepancy may be explained by differences in patient populations, inconsistency of delivery of CPAP/NIV, differing criteria for intubation and the influence  of co-therapy. Other authors showed that pre-hospital nitrate was the only treatment related  to improved survival in a UK study. Medical therapy should therefore always be optimised. NIV  reduced intubation rate in a hypercapnic subgroup. While an early small study suggested an  increase in myocardial rate in patients treated with NIV, this has not borne out in the large 3CPO  trial and meta-analyses.'

  input: Which of the following statements concerning cryptogenic organising pneumonia is correct?
  options:
  - It results in airflow limitation and hyperinflation.
  - It appears almost exclusively in smokers.
  - Histology reveals poorly formed interstitial granulomas.
  - Evaluation of the bronchoalveolar lavage cellular constituents is diagnostic.
  - The histologic appearance is nonspecific and may also result from a variety of lung injuries.
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Smoking is not related to the occurrence of cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP). COP is  associated with a restrictive not an obstructive ventilatory defect and is characterised histopathologically by intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue, consisting of intermixed myofibroblasts  and connective tissue. Poorly formed interstitial granulomas are features of hypersensitivity  pneumonia, not of COP. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis shows a mixed cellular pattern  with an increase in lymphocytes (20–40%), neutrophils (10%) and eosinophils (5%) with the  level of lymphocytes higher than that of eosinophils; a few plasma cells and/or mast cells may  be present in COP. The lymphocytes are activated and the CD4/CD8 ratio is usually decreased.  This pattern is not specific for COP, and thus is not diagnostic. The histological appearance (see  above) is characteristic, although not specific, and is shared by secondary forms of bronchiolitis  obliterans with organising pneumonia
    that may result from a variety of lung injuries (including,  but not limited to infectious agents, drugs and radiation).

  input: An obese (BMI 32.5 kg⋅m−2), diabetic man with arterial hypertension is diagnosed with OSA (AHI  45 events per h). In addition to weight loss, you recommend CPAP treatment. What is an evidence-based benefit of your recommendation?
  options:
  - CPAP is superior to dietary attempts at weight reduction.
  - CPAP lowers systolic arterial blood pressure by >10 mmHg.
  - CPAP is superior to nocturnal oxygen therapy at lowering blood pressure.
  - CPAP and weight loss together are more effective at glycaemic control than either intervention  alone.
  - CPAP is more effective at blood pressure control than weight loss after 6 months of intervention.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Epidemiological studies show that sleep apnoea independently increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Individuals with severe sleep apnoea are at increased risk of coronary artery disease,  congestive heart failure and stroke. The underlying mechanisms are not entirely understood.  Linkage between OSA and cardiovascular disease is supported by evidence that treatment of  sleep apnoea with CPAP reduces blood pressure; however, the effect is quite small, depending  on previous treatment and symptoms. A recent meta-analysis showed a mean decrease in systolic blood pressure of 3.6 mmHg with CPAP therapy. In minimally symptomatic patients, the  effect is even smaller. Several systematic studies are necessary to explain the complex associations between OSA and cardiovascular disease, which may be empowered by the involvement  of diseases comprising the metabolic syndrome (i.e. central obesity, hypertension, diabetes  and dyslipidaemia). Although CPAP might be expected to support
    weight loss by increasing  physical daytime activity, there are no data supporting an effect of CPAP on weight reduction.  Recent studies have shown that weight loss is more effective than CPAP but both interventions  together are better than either alone at lowering blood pressure and insulin resistance, but not  markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein. Oxygen alone does not reduce blood pressure. Extensive weight loss as seen with gastric bypass surgery is very effective at glycaemic  control; comparable effects have not been shown with CPAP.

  input: Which of the following radiological findings is characteristic of pulmonary Langerhans’ cell  histiocytosis?
  options:
  - Patchy consolidation
  - Crazy paving
  - Honeycombing
  - Lower lobe-predominant changes
  - Cavitating nodules
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: The most common radiological findings in pulmonary Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis are nodular and cystic changes, which occur predominantly in the middle and upper lobes. Nodules  may cavitate and disappear or evolve into thin-walled cysts. Patchy infiltrates and thick-walled  cavitations are not features of the disease. Crazy paving is typically seen in alveolar proteinosis.  To date, in the absence of a controlled therapeutic trial, there is no evidence for efficacy of  any treatment for pulmonary Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis, but smoking cessation may lead to  improvement.

  input: A 46-year-old female never-smoker, domestic cleaner, with a BMI of 32.5 kg⋅m−2, is evaluated in  an asthma clinic. She is receiving treatment from her family doctor, with salmeterol/fluticasone  50/500 twice daily and montelukast 10 mg once daily for the past 6 months. She has been taking  salbutamol several times daily and has been waking up 1–2 times every night for the past 2 weeks. Which of the following comorbidities is not related to poor control of her asthma?
  options:
  - Chronic rhinosinusitis
  - Psychological dysfunctioning
  - Obesity
  - Asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux
  - Thyroid disorders
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Asthma control has two domains, i.e. symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes.  The table illustrates how to assess them. The question addresses risk factors for poor outcome.  Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is present in 60–80% of patients with asthma, but clinical  trials with proton pump inhibitor therapy generally show little to no effect on asthma control.  The role of asymptomatic (“silent”) GOR is not established and only treatment of symptomatic  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is recommended in current asthma guidelines. Chronic  rhinosinusitis with or without the presence of nasal polyps is an established comorbidity related  to poor asthma control. Obesity is also a common comorbidity associated with difficult-to-treat  asthma that needs to be addressed in cases of poor asthma control. Anxiety and depression, and  thyroid disorders have been associated with poor asthma control in several studies.

  input: Which of the following statement(s) concerning non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in adults is/are  true?
  options:
  - Male infertility suggests primary ciliary dyskinesia.
  - Measurement of serum immunoglublin IgG, IgA and IgM levels should be performed.
  - Sputum culture should be performed.
  - Inhaled corticosteroids should be prescribed.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - C
  rationale: Bronchiectasis and male infertility are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) but male  infertility is not invariably present in ciliary dysfunction disorders. In females, there is a small risk  of subfertility. Typically, patients with PCD have a long history of continuous coughing, chronic  otitis and sinusitis, and sometimes dextrocardia or complete situs inversus. British Thoracic  Society guidelines recommend that all patients with bronchiectasis be screened for antibody  deficiency by measuring IgG, IgA and IgM levels. Routine assessments of immunoglobulin  subclasses are, however, not recommended for screening. There is no evidence that inhaled  corticosteroids are beneficial in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis unless the patient also suffers from asthma.

  input: A 55-year-old man presents to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia. Which of the following is not a risk factor for an increased chance of death from this pneumonia?
  options:
  - A respiratory rate of 32 breaths per min
  - A blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg
  - A history of COPD and myocardial infarction
  - A two-fold elevation of alanine and aspartate transaminases
  - An elevated level of serum creatinine >220 mmol⋅L−1
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Various tools of risk assessment in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), such as the  Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 score, have been validated so far. The CURB-65  rule (confusion, urea >7 mmol⋅L−1, respiratory rate >30 breaths per min, systolic blood pressure  <90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≤60 mmHg, and age ≥65 years) is the most practical in  its simplicity. In patients with a CURB-65 ≥1 (except age >65 years as the only criterion met),  hospitalisation should be seriously considered, as the risk of mortality is intermediate/high. A  two-fold increase in hepatic enzymes is not a risk factor in CAP. In contrast to the PSI, the CURB65 score does not take into account comorbidities for the calculation of risk, although these  have important implications for the risk of death, the decision to hospitalise and treatment.

  input: Which of the following statements is/are correct regarding multidrug-resistant tuberculosis?
  options:
  - Directly observed therapy (DOT) is highly recommended.
  - One of the drugs used should be an injectable agent for which susceptibility is proven (other  than streptomycin).
  - There is no cross-resistance between injectable agents.
  - When initiating therapy, at least four drugs to which there is in vitro susceptibility should be  given.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - D
  rationale: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care  state in their general principles for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) that  the treatment regimen should consist of at least four drugs with either certain or almost-certain  effectiveness. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to use drugs for which there is the possibility of  cross-resistance. Besides the use of any of the first-line oral agents that are likely to be effective  in a particular case, WHO principles recommend the use of an effective aminoglycoside or polypeptide by injection, a fluoroquinolone and an oral bacteriostatic second-line agent, preferably  cycloserine. Kanamycin or amikacin are the first choice as an injectable agent, although there is  a high rate of cross-resistance. Streptomycin is more toxic and there is a high rate of resistance  in drug-resistant TB. Each dose in an MDR regimen is preferably given as DOT.

  input: For diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which of the following statements is true?
  options:
  - Precipitating serum antibodies (IgG) are very sensitive.
  - A normal alveoloarterial oxygen tension difference excludes hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
  - A delayed cutaneous skin reaction to an incriminated antigen has a high positive predictive  value.
  - A negative allergen avoidance test has a high negative predictive value.
  - A normal differential cell count in the bronchial lavage fluid excludes an acute form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Precipitating serum antibodies are often not identified in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. One  might have a normal alveoloarterial oxygen tension difference (PA−aO2) at rest in the early stage  of the disease but an increasing PA−aO2 during exercise. A delayed skin reaction has not been  proven to be of predictive value for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It is possible that in cases of a  chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergen avoidance might not lead to a quick resolution of  symptoms. In acute forms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the cell count is typically abnormal,  with an increase in total cell count, an increase in lymphocytes and, depending on the timing of  the bronchoalveolar lavage, an increase in neutrophils.

  input: A 58-year-old obese patient (BMI 39.6 kg⋅m−2) complains of new-onset of daytime fatigue and  early morning headache. His wife reports that he snores heavily. The patient had an inferior wall  myocardial infarction 2 years ago. His cardiologist reported normal systolic cardiac function but  grade I diastolic dysfunction 1 month ago. The patient is a lifetime nonsmoker. His past medical  history is unremarkable. A nocturnal pulse oximetry reveals an oxygen desaturation index (>3%)  of 68 events per h. His daytime arterial blood gas analysis shows a PaO2 of 8.8 kPa (66 mmHg), a  PaCO2 of 7.8 kPa (58.5 mmHg), an SpO2 of 93%, a pH of 7.38 and a bicarbonate level of 27 mmol⋅L−1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Complex sleep apnoea syndrome
  - Mixed central and OSAS
  - Cheyne–Stokes respiration syndrome
  - Idiopathic central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome
  - Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Obesity hypoventilation syndrome best fits the description of this patient. The syndrome is  defined as daytime hypercapnia and obesity with no other explanation for hypercapnia. The  patient in the question showed daytime hypercapnia that was not otherwise explained, as no  respiratory diseases are mentioned. Patients with complex sleep apnoea have obstructive sleep apnoea but central sleep apnoea  becomes dominant when the obstructive part is successfully treated. The clinical relevance of  this syndrome is still a matter of debate, as after prolongation of CPAP therapy, this phenomenon may disappear. However, persistent residual central sleep apnoea may disturb sleep quality,  prevent complete symptomatic improvement and may lead to CPAP intolerance. OSAS is not associated with daytime hypercapnia; occasionally, it may lead to nocturnal increase  of carbon dioxide. OSAS is characterised by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper  airway collapse during sleep. According
    to the definition of the American Academy of Sleep  Medicine, apnoea/hypopnoea events last for >10 s and are characterised by >50% decrease  from baseline breathing amplitude during sleep with an oxygen desaturation ≥3% or an arousal.  Alternatively, a 30% reduction in breathing amplitude with an oxygen desaturation >3% also  defines a hypopnoea. Cheyne–Stokes respiration typically occurs in patients with congestive  heart failure or ischaemic stroke. Risk factors are age >60 years, male sex, severe heart failure,  hypocapnia and atrial fibrillation. Central sleep apnoea/hypopnoea (CSA) results from the reduction in ventilation due to transient  loss or reduction of neural output to the respiratory muscles. Idiopathic CSA syndrome is, by  definition, not associated with any underlying disease. CSA causes sleep fragmentation, which  may be perceived as unrefreshing sleep and may result in daytime sleepiness. Idiopathic CSA is  thought to be much less common than OSAS, although no systematic
    epidemiological studies  have been performed. Sleep-induced hypoventilation is characterised by increased PaCO2 levels of >6 kPa (>45 mmHg).  It is associated with decreased ventilatory drive, respiratory iatrogenic depression, alteration of  respiratory nerve conductance, respiratory muscle weakness, chest-wall deformities or severe  obesity.
- id: Q204
  input: Which of the following statements about oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry is/are  correct?
  options:
  - Oxygen saturation is underestimated in mild anaemia.
  - Oxygen saturation is influenced by pH but not by temperature.
  - An oxygen saturation of >94% is a surrogate for adequate tissue oxygenation.
  - Carboxyhaemoglobin reduces saturation measured by pulse oximetry.
  correct_answer: ''
  rationale: None of the answers is correct. The pulse oximeter has become an essential tool in the modern practice of emergency medicine.  However, knowledge of its underlying principles and associated limitations are essential for  appropriate clinical use. For example, hypoxaemia during severe carbon monoxide intoxication  is missed by pulse oximetry due to the absorption of red light by carboxyhaemoglobin instead  of oxyhaemoglobin. Methaemoglobinaemia is not detectable with pulse oximeters. Anaemia  does not interfere with accuracy unless it is very severe (Hb <50 g⋅L−1). Tissue oxygenation is  not assessed by pulse oximetry, as SpO2 does not account for oxygen carriers and tissue delivery.  Thus, in severe anaemia or hypoperfusion, tissue oxygenation may be inappropriate even with  a normal SpO2. PaO2 and oxygen saturation do not correlate linearly. In the higher range of PaO2, there is a flat  portion of the curve where a reduction of PaO2 down to around 8 kPa (60 mmHg) only marginally  affects
    saturation. At lower PaO2, saturation drops steeply. Acidosis, elevated body temperature  and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate move the dissociation curve to the right; thus, oxygen is more easily released from Hb and, thereby, enhances tissue oxygenation.

  input: A 35-year-old builder presents with a 10-year history of progressively worsening daytime sleepiness and disruptive snoring. He now falls asleep several times a day whenever he is inactive, such  as while watching television, and even during work breaks and whilst waiting for lunch to be served  in a restaurant. He is concerned about losing his job. He is a lifetime nonsmoker. He jogs 2–3 km  daily without difficulty. His past history and a review of his symptoms are otherwise unremarkable.  He is 180 cm tall, weighs 91 kg and has a neck circumference of 47.5 cm. Physical examination  is otherwise normal. Polysomnography reveals 62 obstructive apnoeas/hypopnoeas per hour (AHI  62 events per h), mostly associated with oxygen desaturations to 70–79%; sometimes, his SpO2 is  <70%. His waking oxygen saturation is 94%. You recommend CPAP therapy for this patient but he  is not convinced. If he decides against CPAP, which of the following is the most important risk that you should explain  to
    him?
  options:
  - Increased nocturnal mortality
  - Right heart failure, daytime respiratory failure and/or erythrocytosis
  - Systemic hypertension
  - Reduced performance IQ, decreased memory and reduced manual dexterity
  - Increased motor vehicle and industrial accidents
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: This patient is suffering from OSAS. Right heart failure, respiratory failure and secondary erythrocytosis are not typical features of OSAS but of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which  is characterised by alveolar hypoventilation with daytime hypercapnia and hypoxaemia. During  the daytime, this patient has a normal oxygen saturation of 94%. OSAS is associated with increased mortality primarily because of lethal accidents caused by  daytime sleepiness, so either a motor vehicle accident or, as the patient is a builder, a workassociated accident poses by far the highest risk for him. In this young, otherwise healthy man,  OSAS-associated mortality through cardiovascular morbidity due to hypertension and metabolic  disturbances, such as decreased insulin sensitivity and hyperlipidaemia, is much lower than the  hazard of falling asleep at work or behind the wheel. The lack of stage III and IV sleep in OSAS, and nocturnal hypoxaemia, are factors that can cause  memory and
    neurobehavioural problems.

  input: Which of the following factors does not influence TLCO measured by the single-breath method?
  options:
  - Polycythaemia vera
  - Lung haemorrhage
  - Tobacco smoking
  - Ventilation–perfusion inequality
  - Tracheostomy
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: TLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to red blood cells in the  pulmonary capillaries. It is measured by inhaling the tracer gas carbon monoxide. TLCO will be  increased by high Hb levels (polycythaemia) and by red blood cells in the alveolar space following haemorrhage, as these enhance carbon monoxide uptake. TLCO is reduced in smokingrelated lung damage and ventilation–perfusion mismatch. A tracheostomy will reduce upper  airway deadspace but does not influence TLCO.

  input: A 28-year-old, schizophrenic, unemployed man is referred to you for evaluation of an abnormal  chest radiograph and CT. The patient has a 3-month history of chest pain and nonproductive cough  with 4 kg weight loss. The chest radiograph shows an anterior mediastinal mass. This mass is confirmed by chest CT showing probable involvement of the anterior chest wall. CT of the chest and  abdomen is otherwise unremarkable. The physical examination is normal. The patient refuses any  invasive procedures. Which noninvasive test might be of value in confirming a diagnosis?
  options:
  - MRI of the chest
  - Bone scan
  - α-fetoprotein and β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin assay
  - Ultrasound of the testes
  - Iodine-135 radioisotope uptake scan of the thyroid
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Thymoma is the most common primary neoplasm of the anterior mediastinum but its incidence  is greater during the fourth and fifth decades of life. Other malignancies of the anterior mediastinum include mediastinal germ cell tumours (teratomas, and seminomatous and nonseminomatous tumours). The great majority of mediastinal malignant germ cell tumours occur in  patients between 20 and 35 years of age. A diagnosis of a mediastinal germ cell tumour should  be considered in all young males with a mediastinal mass. In addition to physical examination and routine laboratory studies, initial evaluation should include CT of the chest and abdomen, and determination of serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein.  Anterior mediastinal mass imaging is predominantly carried out by CT. In selected cases, there  is a role for MRI. Iodine-125 radioisotope uptake scanning of the thyroid can be useful in cases  of a suspected thyroid neoplasm. In the described case, the CT
    of abdomen is negative, so we  could exclude a testis seminoma. A bone scan could be performed for staging but would not  provide information on the type of neoplasm.

  input: A 69-year-old male, with a history of smoking and asbestos exposure between the ages of 30  and 55 years, complains of right-sided chest pain, breathlessness on exertion and cough. A chest  radiograph shows a right pleural effusion associated with nodular pleural thickening. Thoracentesis  shows a bloody coloured pleural effusion with a cytological suspicion of mesothelioma. Which of the following statements is/are true for this patient?
  options:
  - Thoracoscopy is the preferred diagnostic procedure.
  - Thoracentesis may cause spread of the tumour into the chest wall.
  - The patient’s tobacco use has played a significant role in the development of mesothelioma.
  - Calretinin and Wilms tumour antigen-1 are two immunohistochemical markers with diagnostic value for mesothelioma.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - D
  rationale: Previously considered to be rare, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive  tumour that has become a very important issue over recent years. The disease is associated  with asbestos exposure and its incidence will continue to increase for some years to come even  in regions where the commercial use of asbestos has been banned. It is certain to continue to  contribute to cancer mortality in regions of the world lacking worker protection and persisting  with its commercial use. Agents other than asbestos are considered to be recognised as potential risk factors or cofactors for MPM, namely exposure to other natural or man-made (refractory  ceramic) fibres, ionising radiation and SV40 virus. It is known that tobacco does not play a role  in the development of mesothelioma, as tobacco smoking is not carcinogenic to the pleura. The clinical manifestations of MPM are usually nonspecific and insidious and should not be  used alone as diagnostic criteria, even in
    case of previous asbestos exposure. A chest CT scan  is unsuitable for definitive diagnosis of MPM, but diffuse or nodular pleural thickening is suggestive of the disease. The accurate diagnosis of mesothelioma is made on histopathological  examination. It is not recommended to make a diagnosis of mesothelioma based on cytology  alone because of the high risk of diagnostic error. So, a cytological suspicion of mesothelioma  must be followed by tissue confirmation. Thoracoscopy is preferred for diagnostic investigation,  allowing complete visual examination of the pleura, deep and large biopsies and providing a  diagnosis in more than 90% of cases. Mesothelioma may spread into the chest wall at the site  of thoracentesis. A complementary immunohistochemical examination must be carried out in addition to morphological examination for the diagnosis of MPM. Markers with positive diagnostic value for  mesothelioma are nuclear markers such as calretinin and Wilms tumour antigen-1 (WT-1) or  the
    membrane marker anti-epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and cytokeratin (CK5/6).

  input: Which of the following test results will most reliably differentiate between asthma and emphysema?
  options:
  - A positive methacholine challenge
  - Post-bronchodilator spirometry improvement of 10%
  - FEV1 60% of predicted
  - A reduced TLCO
  - An increased TLC
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Airway hyperresponsiveness with a positive methacholine challenge and post-bronchodilator  spirometry improvement of 10% can be found in both asthma and COPD with emphysema.  Confirmation of a positive bronchodilator reversibility test as one of the characteristics of  asthma requires >12% improvement and >200 mL increase in FEV1. An FEV1 of 60% predicted  or, in fact, any value can be measured in both asthma and emphysema, and even in restrictive  lung and chest wall disease. Lung hyperinflation with increased TLC and decreased FEV1 (airflow  obstruction) can be a finding in both of asthma and emphysema. TLCO is normal or increased in  asthma but is usually low in emphysema.

  input: 'A 25-year-old female has suffered severe peripartum bleeding. She received 20 packed red blood  cell transfusions and five fresh frozen plasma transfusions. After delivery, she had to be intubated  and was placed on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. She is deeply sedated but occasionally triggers the ventilator. On the third day of mechanical ventilation, her arterial blood gas  analysis shows a PaO2 of 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg), PaCO2 of 6.3 kPa (47 mmHg) and pH of 7.33. The ventilator settings are: inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) 0.8; assist control with tidal volume 420 mL  and frequency 18 breaths per min; inspiratory time (tI)/expiratory time (tE) ratio 1/3; and positive  end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 10 cmH2O. Plateau pressure is 32 cmH2O. She weighs 60 kg. Chest  radiography reveals bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.  What would be the most appropriate change in the ventilator settings for this patient?'
  options:
  - Switch to pressure-control ventilation.
  - Decrease PEEP to 8 cmH2O.
  - Decrease tidal volume to 360 mL.
  - Switch to inverse ratio ventilation (tI/tE 2/1).
  - Decrease ventilator frequency to 15 breaths per min.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: 'The patient suffers from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is defined by: bilateral opacities unexplained by nodules, atelectasis or effusion, on chest radiography or CT; new  or worsening respiratory symptoms, or a clinical insult associated with ARDS within 7 days of  diagnosis; objective assessment of cardiac function (e.g. by echocardiography) to exclude cardiogenic pulmonary oedema; and hypoxaemia, with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio ≤40.0 kPa (≤300 mmHg)  despite NIV or invasive mechanical ventilation with PEEP or CPAP ≥5 cmH2O. She should be  ventilated using a lung-protective strategy that encompasses volume-controlled ventilation  with a tidal volume of 4–8 mL⋅kg−1 of ideal body weight, a plateau pressure <30 cmH2O and  a modest level of PEEP. The lung-protective strategy has been shown to decrease mortality  in patients with ARDS while pressure-control ventilation and inverse-ratio ventilation are not  known to improve outcome in ARDS. By decreasing tidal volume
    to 360 mL, the plateau pressure will also decrease, while decreasing the PEEP will probably deteriorate oxygenation. By decreasing the ventilator frequency, the  patient will probably increase their triggering of the ventilator.'

  input: An otherwise healthy 32-year-old woman, who is an employee in a nursing home, is given a  tuberculin skin test (TST). Her reaction is a 2-mm induration. 2 weeks later, on repeat testing, her  reaction is 4 mm. 14 months later, a person in the home is diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis. The TST of the still asymptomatic employee is repeated and shows 22 mm induration at  48 h; an interferon-γ release assay is positive. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs show  no abnormalities. What should be recommended?
  options:
  - Careful observation with sequential chest radiograph and clinical evaluation every 3 months  for the next year
  - Observation for 3 months and then repetition of the skin test
  - 'Three sputum samples should be cultured for mycobacteria: if the results are negative, start  treatment with isoniazid 300 mg daily for 1 year; if the results are positive, give standard treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis'
  - Three sputum samples should be cultured for mycobacteria and then the patient should be  treated with isoniazid 300 mg and rifampicin 600 mg daily for 6 months
  - Treatment with isoniazid 300 mg daily for 6–9 months
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: This asymptomatic employee of a nursing home has all the features of latent tuberculosis.  Her TST has converted after exposure to a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis; the positive  interferon-γ release assay confirms the TST. Her chest radiograph does not show signs of active  tuberculosis. Treatment of persons under the age of 45 years consists of monotherapy with  isoniazid for 6–9 months (table). This aims to prevent later occurrence of active tuberculosis.  Without preventive therapy, the life-time risk of progression from latent to active tuberculosis  is 5–10% for this healthy woman.

  input: A 46-year-old, nonsmoking female patient with no previous disease history is admitted to your  ward with a 2-week history of persistent cough and haemoptysis, and progressive exercise dyspnoea. She reports no fever or upper respiratory symptoms. Physical examination shows normal  vital signs with a SpO2 of 92% in ambient air and scattered bilateral crackles on lung auscultation.  The chest radiograph reveals patchy bilateral alveolar consolidation confirmed by CT. Lung function  tests show a mild restrictive pattern with a TLCO of 110% predicted. Laboratory investigation shows  mild anaemia (Hb 10.5 g⋅dL−1), a normal white blood cell count and differential cell count, haematuria, and proteinuria. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirms alveolar haemorrhage. Which of the following diagnoses would a positive myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic  antibody test favour?
  options:
  - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
  - Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg–Strauss syndrome)
  - Microscopic polyangiitis
  - Pulmonary haemosiderosis
  - Polyarteritis nodosa
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: This patient has alveolar haemorrhage and glomerulonephritis. Except for pulmonary haemosiderosis (which is limited to the lung), all of the diagnoses are vasculitides that may present with  this combination of features (although polyarteritis nodosa rarely involves the lung). A positive  anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test (either myeloperoxidase (MPO) or proteinase-3 (PR3)) is a strong argument against polyarteritis nodosa. The presence of MPO-ANCA  or PR3-ANCA is variable among different ANCA-associated vasculitides (table). The absence of  asthmatic features and of eosinophilia in our patient makes eosinophilic granulomatosis with  polyangiitis less likely. The presence of MPO-ANCA is more frequently associated with microscopic polyangiitis and of PR3-ANCA is more frequently associated with granulomatosis with  polyangiitis. Although the clinical presentation and ANCA type might be highly suggestive of a  specific type of ANCA-associated vasculitis, renal or
    lung biopsy is frequently needed in order to  confirm the diagnosis.

  input: A 75-year-old male complains about increasing dyspnoea on exertion. The patient worked with  building insulation for many years. 10 years ago, he suffered a myocardial infarction. Percussion  reveals dullness of the right lower chest; auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds over the  area of dullness. Chest radiography and ultrasound show a medium-sized pleural effusion, and this  is confirmed by a CT scan, which also shows enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Medical thoracoscopy demonstrates a diffuse malignant mesothelioma on both pleural layers with infiltration of the  pericardium. An endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy revealed bilateral infiltrated  lymph nodes. Immune histology reveals a biphasic cell type. Which one of the following is the best treatment option?
  options:
  - Extrapleural pneumonectomy
  - Debulking surgery (pleurectomy/decortication)
  - Radiotherapy of the hemithorax
  - Chemotherapy with pemetrexed/cisplatin
  - Indwelling pleural catheter
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Combined chemotherapy with an antimetabolite (e.g. pemetrexed) and cisplatin offers the best  treatment option in patients with a good performance score. Surgery is indicated in only a few  selected cases. Because it is T3N3, this is a stage IV mesothelioma and, therefore, does not  warrant an operative approach. Irradiation of the complete hemithorax has been used only in  a multimodal treatment approach combined with extrapleural pneumonectomy. An indwelling  pleural catheter would be indicated for removal of pleural fluid. If the combined chemotherapy is not successful, the treatment of choice for recurring pleural effusion would be pleurodesis. An alternative approach could be thoracoscopic talc poudrage, followed by combined  chemotherapy.

  input: α1-antitrypsin (α1 -AT) deficiency (PiZZ) is detected in a 65-year-old nonsmoker with mild COPD  (FEV1 82% predicted). When counselling the patient, which of the following is/are correct?
  options:
  - His life expectancy is almost normal.
  - His risk of liver cirrhosis is increased.
  - His risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung is increased.
  - The chance of other cases of α1-AT deficiency among his relatives is increased.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - D
  rationale: Low FEV1 is the major risk factor for death in α1 -AT-deficient patients. This patient has an almost  normal FEV1, and is a nonsmoker and 65 years old, so his life expectancy is almost normal. The  chance of liver cirrhosis is increased in α1 -AT-deficient patients but that of lung adenocarcinoma  is not. Siblings of α1 -AT-deficient patients have a 25% chance of α1 -AT deficiency while children  have a 1% chance.

  input: A 24-year-old woman in her 24th week of pregnancy is seen in the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough and sharp pain over the left  lower chest. On examination, there are crackles at the base of the left lung. Her left calf is tender and slightly warm. Her arterial blood gas results are PaO2 10.8 kPa (81 mmHg), PaCO2 4.5 kPa  (34 mmHg) and pH 7.44. D-dimers are positive. What is the first test you should ask for in this patient?
  options:
  - CT pulmonary angiography
  - Compression ultrasound of the lower limbs
  - Venography of the lower limbs
  - Ventilation–perfusion lung scanning
  - Conventional pulmonary angiography
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Compression ultrasound of the lower limbs is the first-line diagnostic test that should be used in  this pregnant woman with possible symptoms of deep vein thrombosis of her left calf because  it is not associated with exposure to radiation. If the ultrasound examination is negative, chest  radiography would be the next recommended test followed by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy if the radiograph was normal (figure). If the scintigraphy is nondiagnostic, CT angiography is recommended. The use of D-dimer tests is discouraged in pregnant women because  D-dimer level increases during normal pregnancy and, therefore, the specificity and sensitivity  of D-dimer during pregnancy are only 15% and 73%, respectively.

  input: Which of the following statements concerning positional OSA is false?
  options:
  - If positional therapy is used for the treatment of OSA, follow-up sleep studies have to be  performed.
  - Body position effects pharyngeal cross-sectional area and, thus, nocturnal respiratory  disturbances.
  - Positional OSA is defined as a supine apnoea/hypopnoea of at least twice that in the lateral  position.
  - Patients with positional OSA tend to have a lower AHI, be younger and be less obese than  patients with nonpositional OSA.
  - Positional therapy is recommended as the first-line therapy for OSA.
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: 'The following effects of changes in body position have been described: • changes in pharyngeal cross-sectional area; • changes in pharyngeal closing pressure; • changes in ventilatory drive; and thus, • changes in sleep-related breathing disturbances. Positional sleep apnoea is defined as a supine AHI of at least twice that in the lateral position.  Using this definition, a prevalence of ∼50% is reported. Patients with positional OSA tend to  have a lower AHI, be younger and be less obese. Accordingly, patients with a clear improvement  of the AHI with positional therapy tend to be younger, have a lower AHI and be less obese. Thus,  they are an easy-to-treat subset of patients. Different devices such as a tennis ball, vests, a positional alarm, verbal instruction and pillows have had moderate effects on AHI in some studies.  However, most studies were uncontrolled and small. Furthermore, long-term compliance was  either poor or not evaluated. Thus, positional therapy is not
    recommended for the treatment of  OSA. If positional therapy is used, follow-up sleep studies are strongly recommended.'

  input: A 35-year-old female is admitted to the emergency department with a history of repeated chest  infections, diarrhoea, otitis media, pneumonia, lethargy and some weight loss. She has areas of  vitiligo and a past history of haemolytic anaemia. Chest radiography shows bilateral mid-zone infiltrates. Pulmonary function tests show a mild restrictive ventilatory defect, with a reduced lung  volume and TLCO. A transbronchial lung biopsy shows a noncaseating granuloma. Which one of the following options is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - Sarcoidosis
  - Tuberculosis
  - Common variable immunodeficiency syndrome
  - Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia
  - Cryptococcosis
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) syndrome is characterised by a reduced level of  immunoglobulins, which results in susceptibility to infections and autoimmune disorders. CVID  may also be associated with noninfectious cutaneous granulomas, or visceral granulomas of the  lungs, liver, spleen or conjunctiva. The cutaneous granulomas are nonspecific in patients with  CVID, and can appear as a maculopapular rash, as infiltrated erythematous papules, plaques,  excoriated papules and ulcers, or as nodules with ulcerations. On histological analysis, such  granulomas are noncaseating and involve the dermis or subcutaneous fat. The diagnosis of CVID should also be considered in patients with certain clinical features of sarcoidosis and noncaseating granulomas, who do not exhibit the characteristic hypogammaglobulinaemia and who have a history of recurrent infections. Although many features of sarcoidosis  in patients with CVID are similar to those of patients with sarcoidosis
    alone, there are many  important differences. Repeated infections, sinus infections, otitis, vitiligo and haemolytic anaemia are not symptoms of sarcoidosis. Thus, patients with CVID in whom sarcoid-type reactions  develop present with hypogammaglobulinaemia rather than hypergammaglobulinaemia, and  have a higher prevalence of recurrent infections, thrombocytopenia and splenic involvement.  Infectious causes of noncaseating granulomas, including fungi, mycobacteria and certain other  bacteria, always have to be considered and evaluated by microscopic and cultural examination. Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia is a lymphoma typically found in elderly patients with  excessive production of IgM. Cryptococcosis is an important infection in immunosuppressed  (HIV) patients. Meningoencephalitis is the most common presentation. Pulmonary Cryptococcus  infection in immunocompetent patients is typically asymptomatic. Possible pulmonary symptoms include productive cough, haemoptysis and dyspnoea,
    in addition to fever, malaise, night  sweats and weight loss.

  input: A 45-year-old female presents to you with increasing cough and fatigue for the past 4 months.  She is a heavy smoker (40 cigarettes per day for 25 years), with a medical history of diabetes and  hypertension. A chest radiograph shows a left upper lobe mass, para-aortic mediastinal lymphadenopathy and ipsilateral pleural effusion. These findings were confirmed on chest CT. Fibreoptic  bronchoscopy with tumour biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Pleural  fluid cytological examination after thoracentesis was also positive for SCLC. Additional workup with  upper abdomen and head CT were negative for metastasis. Her performance status on the ECOG  scale was 0 (fully active, without restrictions). Which one of the following statements for this patient is false?
  options:
  - Chemotherapy with platinum/etoposide given for four to six cycles is the treatment of choice.
  - The patient has extensive disease due to malignant pleural effusion.
  - Her younger age, good performance status and single metastatic site are favourable prognostic  factors.
  - Prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended for this patient, after a complete response in  the re-evaluation after 4 cycles of chemotherapy.
  - Concurrent chemoradiation (platinum/etoposide and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy) is an  alternative treatment choice for this patient.
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 13–20% of all lung cancer cases. SCLC shares a strong  association with tobacco use. Without treatment it tends to lead an aggressive course. SCLC is  staged according to a two-stage system developed by the Veteran’s Administration Lung Cancer  study group as limited disease or extensive disease. Patients with limited disease have involvement restricted to the ipsilateral hemithorax that can be encompassed within a safe radiation treatment plan. Extensive disease is defined as the presence of overt metastatic disease.  Patients with otherwise limited-stage disease with the presence of contralateral hilar, supraclavicular nodes, malignant pleural or pericardial effusions (as for this patient) are categorised  as extensive-stage SCLC. The SCLC algorithm was revised in 2011 to include the TNM staging  information, but as most of the literature classifies patients based on limited or extensive-stage  disease, these definitions are still
    most relevant for clinical decision making. Poor performance status (PS), extensive-stage disease, weight loss and markers associated with  excessive bulk of the disease (such as LDH) are the most important adverse prognostic factors.  Younger age, good PS, normal LDH and a single metastatic site are favourable prognostic factors  in patients with extensive-stage SCLC (as for this patient). Chemotherapy with etoposide/platinum regimens given for four to six cycles is the treatment of choice for extensive-stage SCLC (as  for this patient). After chemotherapy, patients achieving a complete response outside the chest  and complete or partial response in the chest can be offered consolidative radiotherapy in the  chest. Concurrent thoracic radiotherapy early during chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in  limited disease, if the patient is fit enough and the tumour volume is not too bulky. Concurrent  chemoradiation has no place in extensive-stage disease (as for this patient). Brain
    metastases are common in SCLC. In patients who achieve a complete response to induction therapy, central nervous system (CNS) metastases will emerge over the next 2 years in  approximately 50–60% of patients, and in 20–30% of patients, the brain will be the only apparent site of disease. Studies have shown that prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) can reduce the  risk of CNS failure and improve survival, without excessive toxicity. So, most recent guidelines  (like NCCN and ESMO) recommend that patients with any response to first-line treatment irrespective of stage should be offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) after the completion of  first-line treatment (as for this patient).

  input: Which of the following is associated with moderately severe thoracic scoliosis (Cobb angle 60–90°)?
  options:
  - Increased functional residual capacity
  - Increased residual volume/TLC ratio
  - Increased expiratory reserve volume
  - Reduced inspiratory capacity
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - D
  rationale: 'Scoliosis alters the shape of the thoracic cavity and, therefore, also influences diaphragmatic  function. Moderate and severe scoliosis usually cause a restrictive ventilatory pattern. A decrease  in chest wall compliance and asymmetric inspiration caused by the deformation of the thoracic  cavity (in idiopathic cases, frequently associated with lung hypoplasia) result in a decrease in  vital capacity and TLC. The disease might also be associated with neuromuscular weakness that  may further corrupt respiratory function. The Cobb angle indicates the severity of the disease:  mild scoliosis is marked by Cobb angle <30°, and moderate cases between 30° and 45°. A Cobb  angle of 60-90° described here (figure) indicates severe scoliosis that is usually associated with  respiratory complications. Typical lung function changes consist of a decrease in TLC and a  decrease in tidal volume. Residual volume (RV) remains usually in the normal range; therefore,  the RV/TLC ratio increases.
    In most cases, functional residual capacity is maintained or slightly  decreased (except if there is air trapping due to small airway compression). Both expiratory  reserve volume and inspiratory capacity decrease.'

  input: A 32-year-old man, known to be HIV-positive for 4 years, is referred to you for evaluation of pulmonary complaints and possible sputum induction. Approximately 2 years ago, the patient developed  a chronic, productive cough that has persisted. The sputum colour varies, ranging from white to   yellow and green. Several courses of antibiotic therapy have cleared the sputum colour to white  each time, but sputum purulence recurs. He has had intermittent fever but does not have night  sweats. He is dyspnoeic only on extreme exertion. He has not received anti-HIV medication or  trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. He does not smoke cigarettes. He smoked marijuana in  the past but quit 7 months ago. Physical examination reveals a thin, tired-looking man. The  remainder of the physical examination is normal. A chest radiograph shows increased markings,  primarily in the lung bases, but is unchanged compared with 3, 6 and 9 months ago. The CD4  count is 253 cells per mm3, and serum lactate
    dehydrogenase is 120 U⋅L−1. Arterial blood gases  while breathing ambient air are PaO2 88 mmHg (11.7 kPa), PaCO2 36 mmHg (4.8 kPa) and pH 7.44. What should be recommended?
  options:
  - and pH 7.44. What should be recommended?
  - CT scan of the chest
  - Sweat chloride test
  - Empiric therapy with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole
  - Biopsy of the nasal mucosa
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The patient’s clinical history is suggestive for bronchiectasis, due to the recurrent bacterial lower  respiratory tract infections in the past occurring because of an impaired immunological defence.  Another differential diagnostic consideration would be lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis in  patients with HIV who have a long standing infiltrate. The patient’s clinical history is not suggestive for a Pneumocystis infection. Furthermore the  patient is not hypoxaemic and his LDH is normal findings that are commonly encounterd in  patients with a pneumocystis infection. The sweat chloride test test is used to screen for cystic fibrosis, which is not likely in this case;  most cystic fibrosis patients will have health problems since early childhood. Empiric therapy with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole might resolve this episode of a  lower respiratory tract infection but will not give an answer for the recurrent episodes of lower   respiratory tract infections. However, trimethoprim
    and sulfamethoxazole might be indicated as  a prophylaxis for pneumocystis infections as his CD4 count is low. Any World Health Organization  (WHO) clinical stage of HIV infection with CD4 <350 cells per mm3 or WHO clinical stage 3 or 4  irrespective of CD4 count should receive P. jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. A nasal biopsy might be performed in a case where primary ciliary dyskinesia is suspected. If this  would be the diagnosis, one would expect the patient to have complaints of recurrent respiratory tract infections from childhood onwards.

  input: A 75-year-old man with COPD has been treated with low-dose oral corticosteroids. He has had   multiple acute exacerbations, which were treated with amoxicillin; the most recent one was  3 weeks ago. He now presents with pleuritic chest pain of acute onset, cough with purulent sputum, fever up to 38.5 °C and right lower lobe consolidation on chest radiography. A sputum sample  shows sheets of neutrophils with intra- and extracellular Gram-positive diplococci. The patient is  admitted to the hospital. Which of the following is the best initial empiric therapy for this patient?
  options:
  - Erythromycin, 250 mg intravenously every 6 h
  - Ceftriaxone, 2 g intravenously every 24 h
  - Doxycycline, 100 mg intravenously every 24 h
  - Penicillin G, 500 mg intravenously every 4 h
  - Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, 160 mg trimethoprim plus 800 mg sulfamethoxazole,   intravenously every 8 h
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia and the sputum sample is indicative of the  presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae. As the patient has been treated with amoxicillin many  times lately, the risk of resistance of S. pneumoniae is considered high not only to penicillins,  but also to macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole; therefore, treatment  with ceftriaxone is a reasonable choice.

  input: A 46-year-old female with a BMI of 26 kg⋅m−2 suffers from OSAS. The patient’s AHI in a recent  sleep study was 34 events per h with an average of 30 obstructive and four central events per hour.  You explain the available treatment options to the patient in the presence of her husband. She is  not enthusiastic about nasal CPAP but agrees to try it. After 3 weeks, she declares that CPAP was  not acceptable for her, mainly for psychological reasons. She asks for another treatment modality.  Which is the next appropriate examination that helps to decide on an alternative treatment?
  options:
  - Measurement of thyroid hormones
  - Review of the sleep study regarding body position
  - Nasal endoscopy
  - Spirometry
  - Inspection of the oral cavity
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: The main treatment for OSAS is nocturnal CPAP. Adjunctive measures are lifestyle modification  with regular sleeping hours, sufficient nocturnal rest, and avoidance of alcohol, sedatives and  smoking. In recent trials, lifestyle modification combined with a very low-calorie diet provided  some relief of OSAS in obese patients but there are doubts as to whether obesity can be persistently controlled by diet alone. Supine position may aggravate OSAS but positional therapy  has not been shown to provide appropriate control of sleep-related breathing disturbances in  OSAS. Nasal obstruction may aggravate OSAS, and promote snoring and sleep disturbances.  However, treatment of chronic nasal obstruction with topical corticosteroids or surgery is not  sufficiently effective as a sole therapy for OSAS. Spirometry is helpful in screening for concomitant obstructive or restrictive lung disease but is unlikely to contribute much to the selection  of OSAS therapy in this patient. Hypothyroidism
    may predispose to OSAS but routine measurement of thyroid hormones in OSAS patients without clinical suspicion of thyroid dysfunction is  not recommended because of the low diagnostic yield. Treatment of OSAS with a mandibular  advancement device is an effective alternative to CPAP. In studies comparing CPAP with mandibular advancement device therapy, CPAP provided a more complete control of sleep apnoea.  Therefore, CPAP is the primary recommended treatment. If CPAP is not feasible, a mandibular  advancement device is a valuable alternative. It requires a minimal number of six to eight upper  and lower teeth and, therefore, inspection of the oral cavity is essential to assess the feasibility  of this therapy.

  input: Which of the following diseases is/are associated with upper lobe fibrosis and loss of volume on  chest radiography?
  options:
  - Sarcoidosis
  - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  rationale: Upper lobe fibrosis (usually posterior) associated with loss of volume is characteristic of the  classic pulmonary granulomatous diseases of tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. Hypersensitivity  pneumonitis which is also granulomatous histologically typically results in upper lobe fibrosis  with volume loss as an end-stage radiological appearance of long-standing chronic disease.  The radiographic opacities of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in which granuloma formation also  occurs, tend to predominate in the upper and mid zones, but because of the development of  multiple cystic areas, there is no loss of volume which may indeed be increased. Rheumatoid  pulmonary fibrosis which is primarily fibrotic with no preceding granulomatous inflammation  is similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and asbestosis and in these diseases, radiological  evidence of fibrosis mainly affects the lower zones.

  input: An 18-year-old woman has had a cough and progressive dyspnoea for the past 3 years. The cough  is nonproductive and is usually associated with exercise. She has had episodes of bronchitis with  purulent thick sputum lasting ∼1 week, which were treated with antibiotics. Over the past year, she  has experienced chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance and increasingly frequent episodes  of bronchitis. She has had a 3-week trial of oral corticosteroids, with little change in her symptoms.  She is a nonsmoker. Her 20-year-old brother has asthma. The patient appears to be well nourished. Her blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse rate is 80 beats per min and regular, and respiratory rate is 18 breaths per min. A chest examination and radiograph are normal. Arterial blood  gases on room air show a PaO2 of 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg), PaCO2 of 4.4 kPa (33 mmHg) and pH of 7.45.  Pulmonary function tests show an FVC of 2.92 L (90% predicted), FEV1 of 2.0 L (75% predicted)  and FEV1/FVC of 68%.
    FEV1 increases by 10% following inhalation of albuterol. Sputum culture  reveals Staphylococcus aureus. Which test is most likely to lead you to the correct diagnosis?
  options:
  - A methacholine challenge test
  - A sinus radiograph
  - A barium oesophagram
  - and FEV1/FVC of 68%. FEV1 increases by 10% following inhalation of albuterol. Sputum culture  reveals Staphylococcus aureus. Which test is most likely to lead you to the correct diagnosis?
  - A flexible bronchoscopy
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Chronic cough and progressive dyspnoea in a patient with recurrent episodes of increased and  purulent sputum, progressive fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance suggest a progressive  chronic lung disease with frequent flare-ups. The patient also has a moderate obstructive ventilatory defect and slight hypoxaemia with hypocapnia. Both the purulent exacerbations and  isolation of S. aureus suggest bronchiectasis. Cystic fibrosis is a chronic progressive lung disease  with bronchiectasis that may manifest itself in a young adult. A sweat chloride test is likely  to lead to a correct diagnosis. Although her brother has asthma, the clinical pattern does not  suggest asthma (no wheezing or paroxysmal dyspnoea) and oral steroids had no effect; consequently, a methacholine challenge test would not be expected to provide useful information.  Chronic rhinosinusitis and gastro-oesophageal reflux are frequent causes of chronic cough but  they are rarely associated with chronic dyspnoea,
    an obstructive ventilatory defect or hypoxaemia; therefore, neither sinus radiography nor a barium oesophagram is likely to confirm a  diagnosis in this patient. Flexible bronchoscopy is unlikely to lead to a definite diagnosis. Chest  CT (with contrast) would be useful to define the lung lesions and to confirm the presence of  bronchiectasis; lung volumes and TLCO measurement would also be useful to define lung function impairment in this patient.

  input: A 35-year-old female presents to her family physician with unproductive cough and fever up to  37.8°C (axillary) during the past 48 h. On physical examination, she presents end-inspiratory crackles at the left lung base on auscultation, with no other abnormal findings. Chest radiography reveals  a small consolidation in the left lower lung field. Her SpO2 was 97% on room air. Which of the following investigations is necessary for the management of this patient?
  options:
  - Pneumococcal urine antigen test
  - Serological testing for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia
  - Blood cultures
  - Sputum sampling for Gram stain and culture
  - No further tests are required
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: This patient has community-acquired pneumonia of low severity (CRB-65 score 0; table).  According to current guidelines, she should be routinely managed empirically with antibiotics  as an outpatient and no further investigations are necessary in the primary care setting in this  low-risk patient. Several scores have been developed to assess severity of pneumonia and associated mortality.  Two well-validated and simple scores are the CURB-65 and its derivative that does not require  a laboratory study, the CRB-65. Using the  CURB-65 index, pneumonia is considered mild (score 0–1, mortality 1.5%), moderate (score 2,  mortality 9.2%), or severe (score 3–5, mortality 22%). Using the CRB-65 index, which does not  depend on laboratory tests and is therefore particularly suitable for primary care, pneumonia  is considered mild (score 0, mortality 1.5%), moderate (score 1–2, mortality 8.2%), or severe  (score 3–4, mortality 31%). In patients with a CRB-65 of ≥1 (except age ≥65 years
    alone) hospitalisation should be seriously considered. In more severe patients requiring hospitalisation, blood cultures should be obtained and a sputum Gram stain performed if a purulent sputum sample can be obtained and processed in a  timely manner. Pneumococcal or Legionella urine antigen tests are recommended in patients  hospitalised for severity of illness. Serological testing for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia species is  more useful in epidemiological studies than for acute management of an individual patient.

  input: A 68-year-old male with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is consulting you in the presence of his wife  and daughter. Four months ago, medical examinations performed to evaluate the cause of weakness  in his arms led to the diagnosis. During the consultation, the patient and his family ask you to give  them an honest estimate of how long he has to live. The patient is currently in fairly good condition,  has a normal weight and is able to walk without dyspnoea, and he has no orthopnoea. Neurological  examination confirms weakness of both arms, more on the left, and fasciculations of the tongue. Which one of the following examinations is least likely to give you information relevant for assessing the prognosis?
  options:
  - Spirometry
  - 6-min walking distance
  - Peak cough flow
  - Observing the patient when drinking water
  - Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease affecting the upper and lower motor  neurons. It generally affects elderly males and females (>65 years) but may occur in younger  subjects as well. The aetiology is not known but a genetic predisposition seems to play a role,  since there is a familiar form of ALS. The disease has a grim prognosis with a survival from onset  of symptoms of 2–4 years. Death occurs mostly from respiratory causes, including subacute and  chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness, and pneumonia and asphyxia  due to foreign body aspiration. In the most common spinal-onset form of ALS (80% of cases),  initial presentation includes asymmetric limb weakness with progressive difficulties walking  and using hands and arms. The bulbar-onset form of ALS (20% of cases) is characterised by  dysarthria, difficulties swallowing and ineffective cough. Both the spinal and bulbar forms are  also associated with respiratory muscle
    weakness leading to progressive respiratory failure.  Compared with the spinal-onset form, survival in the bulbar-onset form is reduced. Recent studies have suggested that noninvasive positive pressure ventilation improves quality  of life and survival of patients with ALS. Patients with the spinal form are more likely to benefit  than those with the bulbar form. Vital capacity has been shown to correlate with prognosis in  ALS. Typically, vital capacity measured in the supine position is more impaired than that in the  upright position, a finding suggesting diaphragmatic weakness. Respiratory muscle strength is  also assessed by the sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, which is easier to perform for ALS patients  than maximal inspiratory pressure manoeuvres. A reduction of the sniff nasal inspiratory pressure to <40 cmH2O has been associated with survival of <6 months. Weakness of expiratory  muscles and ineffective cough may predispose to respiratory infections. Letting patients cough  over
    the course of a forced expiratory manoeuvre normally shows supramaximal flows, i.e. flow  rates that exceed the maximal expiratory flow curve during spirometry. The inability to achieve  supramaximal flow and a peak cough flow of <270 L⋅min−1 have also been associated with a  poor prognosis in ALS. Contrary to the tests mentioned above, the 6-min walk distance is not  used to assess prognosis in ALS.

He is non-atopic, has  cardiomegaly and a pulse rate of 58 beats per min. His baseline lung function is normal (FEV1 3.8 L,  105% predicted). 15 min after a standard maximal exercise protocol his FEV1 is 2.9 L and his pulse  rate is 68 beats per min. The most probable cause of the findings is:'
  options:
  - Obesity-related airway hyperresponsiveness
  - Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction
  - Exercise-induced anaphylaxis
  - Exercise-induced vocal cord dysfunction
  - Cardiomyopathy
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: FEV1 increases in healthy subjects during exercise due to sympathetic activation causing  broncho dilation. If no change occurs it is still counted as a normal airway response. In asthma,  the inflammatory cells in the airway wall, including mast cells, release bronchoconstrictive  mediators during exercise due to drying and cooling of the airways. These mediators result in  bronchoconstriction usually developing within 5–20 min after exercise. This is called exerciseinduced bronchospasm and it is considered as a specific form of airway hyperresponsiveness,  and exercise testing is used as an indirect airway challenge (in other words bronchoprovocation testing) to assess airway hyperresponsiveness. The test is referred to as indirect because  broncho constriction does not occur directly due to the stimulus, but due to the mediators  released by the stimulus. In this case, the decrease of 24% in FEV1 is diagnostic for exerciseinduced asthma. Exercise can cause systemic reactions
    including anaphylaxis; however, in this case report there  is no indication of tachycardia or any other symptoms of anaphylaxis. Vocal cord dysfunction  results in variable and non-reproducible upper airway obstruction due to variable closure of the  vocal cords often manifested as inspiratory stridor.

  input: A 21-year-old female is referred to your clinic for further evaluation of her asthma. She describes  typical symptoms of asthma including night-time cough and wheeze, as well as shortness of breath  in the daytime that limits her ability to play sport. She has been prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid  but she does not wish to take this medication because she has heard that steroids are dangerous.  In particular, she states that she read about a person that developed ‘a brain fungal infection when  they used steroids’. Which approach is best used to enhance her adherence to therapy?
  options:
  - Inform her that she must take the inhaled steroid.
  - Insist that her idea that brain fungal infection occurs as a side-effect of the course of treatment of asthma with corticosteroids is nonsense and illustrate this point by reference to distinguished medical journals.
  - Suggest that she seek care with alternative, complimentary medicine such as herbal therapy.
  - Acknowledge her beliefs and indicate that you do not necessarily share this concern, but agree  to consider alternative therapies such as a leukotriene inhibitor.
  - Recognising that she is at extreme risk of a further, possibly fatal exacerbation, administer an  intramuscular corticosteroid, to keep her safe.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: 'Adherence to medication is a behaviour. A framework for understanding the main drivers of  adherence is the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation Behavioral framework. This framework suggests that health behaviours, including adherence to therapy, are driven by one of three dimensions: comprehension, opportunity and motivation. In this case, the patient’s comprehension is  the challenge to her adherence. She has developed an abnormal belief in the side-effects related  to steroids. Insisting that she should change her beliefs or ignore them, even if it is obvious that  she is at risk, without acknowledging her concerns will not achieve enhanced adherence. Thus,  shared decision-making, which is evidence based for the management of asthma, is likely to  enhance her adherence to therapy.'

  input: A 42-year-old male with COPD returning from a trip to Kenya 6 weeks ago has been diagnosed  with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) after a 10-day hospitalisation for a respiratory  tract infection. His 38-year-old wife is asymptomatic with normal chest radiography and has an  unremarkable past medical history. Her tuberculin skin test (TST) is 0 mm. Which of the following should be recommended to her?
  options:
  - 9 months’ treatment with isoniazid
  - Evaluation with an interferon-γ release assay
  - Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination
  - Repeat TST 2–3 months later
  - No further testing or treatment
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: The wife represents a close contact of a patient with active smear-positive pulmonary TB. Given  the short history of her husband’s illness, the evaluation of a TST in this woman may fall in the  ‘window period’ after a recent sensitisation, usually lasting 4–8 weeks. Therefore, a second TST  after 2–3 months should be performed in order to evaluate conversion and take a definitive  decision on treatment of latent TB infection. At the current time, there is no need for treatment  of latent tuberculosis and BCG vaccination is not indicated. An interferon-γ release assay is   indicated as an alternative to TST or to confirm a positive TST. Moreover, in this apparently  healthy woman there is no reason to consider a false-negative result of the TST.

  input: An 18-year-old competitive swimmer is referred to your clinic for evaluation. She is very keen to  obtain a certificate for competition that confirms that she has asthma. She reports that she regularly uses short- and long-acting β-agonists as well as an inhaled corticosteroid for her asthma. Physical examination reveals no wheezing. Further testing shows an exhaled nitric oxide fraction  (FeNO) of 3 ppb and serum IgE concentration of 3 kU⋅L−1, and a full blood count shows an eosinophil  count of >1.5 × 105 per L. A bronchial provocation test with methacholine demonstrates a provocative concentration causing a 10% fall in FEV1 of 16 mg⋅mL−1. Peak flow recorded by the patient over  a month shows normal diurnal variation (9%) and the patient has normal spirometry. Which of the test results makes asthma unlikely in this case?
  options:
  - The FeNO
  - The IgE level
  - The spirometry
  - The methacholine provocation test
  - The eosinophil count
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Asthma can be difficult condition to diagnose. The most reliable diagnosis is made by finding  a significant variation in airflow over time. Usually, this is achieved by repeated spirometry,  particularly in the morning before the patient has taken any bronchodilator therapy, or having  the patient monitor their peak expiratory flow rate. In the absence of excessive peak flow  variability (>10% within a day), a normal bronchoprovocation test makes the diagnosis of  asthma extremely unlikely. Many patients with asthma, especially when treated with inhaled  cortico steroids, have normal IgE, peripheral blood eosinophil levels and normal FeNO, making  these tests too insensitive to be reliable for exact clinical diagnosis, as would be required to  issue an official therapeutic medication exemption form.

  input: A 58-year-old, never-smoking woman is referred to you because of progressive dyspnoea. This  patient grew up in a rural area. She is now divorced and has lived alone in a new, four-room flat for  4 years. She works part-time as a house cleaner in a home for children. For 1 h a week, she works  in the laundry room, where she sometimes notices humid walls. The chest radiograph is normal.  Pulmonary function testing reveals an FEV1 of 1.45 L (77% of predicted), an FVC of 1.66 L (74% of  predicted) and a TLCO of 2.3 mmol⋅min−1⋅kPa−1 (34% of predicted). A pulmonary thromboembolism  has been excluded by a negative D-Dimer test. The patient’s family doctor advises her to stop working  for 4 weeks. Dyspnoea and pulmonary function thereafter are unchanged. Further diagnostic workup reveals a cell count in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 653 per μL (60% lymphocytes,  5% neutrophils, 3% mast cells and 32% macrophages). Serum precipitins to common antigens are  negative. In this situation,
    which of the following statements is correct?
  options:
  - Lymphocytic alveolitis is specific to hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
  - The BAL findings together with the normal chest radiograph and a ground-glass pattern on  HRCT are suggestive of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
  - The suspected allergen is probably in the work environment of the patient.
  - and a TLCO of 2.3 mmol⋅min−1⋅kPa−1 (34% of predicted). A pulmonary thromboembolism  has been excluded by a negative D-Dimer test. The patient’s family doctor advises her to stop working  for 4 weeks. Dyspnoea and pulmonary function thereafter are unchanged. Further diagnostic workup reveals a cell count in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 653 per μL (60% lymphocytes,  5% neutrophils, 3% mast cells and 32% macrophages). Serum precipitins to common antigens are  negative. In this situation, which of the following statements is correct?
  - The patient is equally likely to be suffering from desquamative interstitial pneumonitis as from  hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: The patient’s history is compatible with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis, especially in the absence  of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Otherwise, sarcoidosis might also be considered. Other diseases such as sarcoidosis or lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis may also present as  a ‘lymphocytic alveolitis’. If >50% of lymphocytes are found in a diffuse parenchymal lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis is very likely. The suspected allergen is unlikely to be in the  workplace because the patient does not improve after a 4 weeks leave from her job. In some cases, it is not possible to detect the responsible antigen in patients proven to have  hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) is a rare condition that usually affects smokers in  their fourth or fifth decades. It is twice as common in men as in women. The term DIP was  originally used to describe a diffuse parenchymal lung disease that was believed to occur as a  result of desquamation
    of alveolar epithelial cells. However, it is now known that this pathological abnormality represents accumulation of macrophages, which usually contain pigment  related to tobacco smoke. This observation has prompted the theory that DIP and respiratory  bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) may be related conditions representing  two ends of a spectrum of smoking-related ILD.

  input: A 58-year-old woman is referred to you. She has dyspnoea on minimal exertion, stopped smoking 5 years ago, and is on regular treatment with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.  Pulmonary function tests show FEV1 0.41 L (18% predicted), FVC 0.82 L (30% predicted), FEV1/FVC  51%, TLC 8.12 L (170% predicted) and residual volume 6.49 L (359% predicted). Her TLCO is 15%  of predicted. On exercise testing, her peak oxygen consumption is 21% predicted. Chest CT shows  diffuse emphysema. Over the last 16 months, her clinical condition has remained stable but   pulmonary function has slightly declined. What is the most appropriate next step for the management of this patient?
  options:
  - Continue the current medical treatment only.
  - Refer for evaluation for lung transplantation.
  - Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction.
  - and residual volume 6.49 L (359% predicted). Her TLCO is 15%  of predicted. On exercise testing, her peak oxygen consumption is 21% predicted. Chest CT shows  diffuse emphysema. Over the last 16 months, her clinical condition has remained stable but   pulmonary function has slightly declined. What is the most appropriate next step for the management of this patient?
  - Pulmonary rehabilitation followed by lung volume reduction surgery.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: 'This 58-year-old patient with COPD of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease  grade 4 is highly symptomatic and her peak oxygen consumption is very low. She should be  referred for evaluation for lung transplantation to a specialist centre. The decision of whether a  patient with severe COPD should be referred for lung transplantation or not is based on various  factors: • Severity of functional impairment • Comorbidity • Lung function and changes in lung function over time • Blood gases • Presence of pulmonary hypertension Transplantation improves functional capacity in COPD. Whether it also improves survival is less  clear. In the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, the overall survival advantage in patients undergoing lung volume reduction surgery was best in patients with upper lobe emphysema and low  exercise capacity. Patients with FEV1 <20% predicted and either TLCO <20% predicted or nonupper lobe emphysema on chest CT had a marked increase in early mortality.
    Thus, lung volume  reduction surgery is less effective in homogenous emphysema and bears the risk of worsening  gas exchange in this patient with very low TLCO. A lung volume reduction procedure might be  considered as a bridge to transplant in highly selected patients.'

  input: A 68-year-old man is treated with nocturnal CPAP at 8 mbar because of a central sleep apnoea  syndrome due to his congestive heart failure. His medical history is remarkable for aortocoronary  bypass surgery 2 years ago, after his second myocardial infarction. His left ventricular ejection fraction is 30%. He is treated with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, spironolactone  and β-blockers. His ECG reveals sinus rhythm and the R-wave is lacking in the anterior leads. He  has problems wearing the CPAP mask every night and he asks about the benefit of CPAP treatment. Which of the following benefits is scientifically established?
  options:
  - Decreased mortality
  - Decreased risk of hospitalisation due to heart failure
  - Decreased need for cardiac medication
  - Increased left ventricular ejection fraction
  - Better sleep quality at night
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: CPAP therapy for central sleep apnoea is controversial but has been shown to increase left ventricular ejection fraction. CPAP increases the intrathoracic pressure and, therefore, lowers the  cardiac preload and transmural cardiac pressure; CPAP decreases the sympathetic overactivity that accompanies central sleep apnoea. These mechanisms support the failing heart and  increase the left ventricular ejection fraction. CPAP has been shown to decrease neither mortality or the need for cardiac medications nor  hospitalisation rate. CPAP also has not consistently improved the sleep quality of patients with  central sleep apnoea due to heart failure.

  input: Which of the following statements concerning the management of spontaneous pneumothorax  is/are true?
  options:
  - Observation is the preferred method in an asymptomatic patient with a rim of 3 cm.
  - A small (visible rim at the level of the hilum of ∼1 cm) pneumothorax in a patient with dyspnoea  is best treated by observation.
  - Prevention of recurrence is best achieved by pleurodesis.
  - Surgical treatment is indicated for the first episode of secondary pneumothorax.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: In the case of a large asymptomatic pneumothorax, aspiration or drainage is the preferred mode  of treatment. Patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and symptoms  such as breathlessness associated with any size of pneumothorax should undergo active intervention. The risk of a recurrence after a spontaneous pneumothorax is around 40–50%. After  pleurodesis with instillation of talc, this risk is around 10%. If pleurodesis is established by a  surgical procedure (pleural rubbing and/or partial pleurectomy), this risk is only 1–5 %. Surgical  intervention is only indicated in cases of a persistent (large) air leak or for a recurrent secondary  pneumothorax.

  input: Which of the following statements regarding the role of echocardiography and right heart catheterisation in the evaluation of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is/are correct?
  options:
  - Echocardiography is the investigation of choice for noninvasive screening in suspected PH.
  - Echocardiographic diagnosis of PH is based on tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity and  Doppler-calculated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure at rest assuming a normal right atrial  pressure of 5 mmHg.
  - PH has been defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥25 mmHg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≥15 mmHg at rest, as assessed by right heart catheterisation.
  - Right heart catheterisation is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension in most patients.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - D
  rationale: 'PH is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mean Ppa) ≥25 mmHg at rest,  as assessed by right heart catheterisation (RHC). The terms ‘pulmonary hypertension’ and ‘pulmonary arterial hypertension’ appear to be quite similar, and this has led to confusion and ambiguity  in both common clinical practice and the medical literature. In the updated clinical classification of  PH, 37 clinical conditions with PH are classified into six groups according to pathological, pathophysiological and therapeutic characteristics: pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1); pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and/or pulmonary capillary haemagiomatosis (group 1′); PH due to  left heart disease (group 2); PH due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia (group 3); chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH) (group 4); and PH with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5). Echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive tool to screen for the presence of PH and to follow  the progression of
    the disease. Indeed, echocardiographic estimates of Ppa generally correlate  well with those obtained by RHC. However, echocardiography may both overestimate and underestimate pulmonary arterial systolic pressures. Guidelines on PH from the European Society of  Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society delineate criteria for estimating the likelihood of  PH based on the tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity, the Doppler-calculated systolic Ppa at rest  and additional echocardiographic parameters that might raise or reinforce the suspicion of PH. In clinical practice, PH is discovered by Doppler echocardiography, either performed for this  purpose or requested for another indication. In the majority of patients, one of the two most  common clinical PH groups can be found (left heart disease and lung diseases) either directly  by echocardiography (left heart disease), or by additional procedures, such as chest radiography,  pulmonary function tests and HRCT of the chest (lung diseases).
    In these cases, the invasive  confirmation of PH is not generally required, except in specific circumstances, such as in candidates for conventional cardiac surgery or for heart or lung transplantation. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterised by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance.  Therefore RHC with a measured mean Ppa ≥25 mmHg and a wedge pressure ≤15 mmHg is necessary to diagnose the condition. A wedge pressure >15 mmHg points to a post-capillary form  of PH, and excludes pulmonary arterial hypertension. According to the current guidelines, RHC is  indicated in all patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension to confirm the diagnosis, to evaluate the severity, and when pulmonary arterial hypertension-specific drug therapy is considered.'

  input: Which of the following statements concerning malignant mesothelioma of the pleura is true?
  options:
  - Mesothelioma is linked to cigarette smoking.
  - Lack of mesothelin in the pleural fluid most likely excludes a pleural mesothelioma.
  - Immunohistology distinguishes mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma.
  - The histological subtype is essential for the selection of treatment.
  - Pleural plaques are premalignant lesions.
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: 'Mesothelioma is linked to asbestos exposure and probably to radiotherapy. Smoking, however,  is not a risk factor for mesothelioma. Mesothelin in the pleural fluid is a tumour marker with a low sensitivity (67%) but a high  specificity (98%) for pleural mesothelioma; therefore, mesothelin is not suited to exclude  mesothelioma. Cytological examination of pleural fluid might not be able to distinguish between malignant  mesothelioma and pleural metastases of an adenocarcinoma (cells from these two types of  malignancies may be cytologically indistinguishable from each other), immunohistological  examination of a pleural biopsy remains the gold standard method to distinguish between these  two diagnoses. There are three histological subtypes of mesothelioma: epitheloid, sarcomatoid and mixed type.  The epitheloid subtype has the best prognosis, but the histological subtype is not essential for  the selection of treatment. There is no evidence that pleural plaques confer an increased
    risk of lung cancer or pleural mesothelioma within a population of individuals having the same cumulative asbestos exposure.'

  input: A 75-year-old woman with severe COPD is admitted to the hospital with hypercapnic respiratory  failure. She has been taking long-term corticosteroids and, during exacerbations, receives 40 mg  prednisolone per day. On day 7 of mechanical ventilation, the patient is febrile with a temperature  to 39°C and has purulent sputum. Her leukocyte count is 18 000 cells per μL. A chest radiograph  shows new bilateral lower-lobe patchy infiltration. She is treated with amikacin and imipenem.  3 days later, she has a reduction in her fever and her sputum becomes slightly less purulent, but  her infiltrates persist and she remains mechanically ventilated. A sputum culture obtained before  starting therapy shows Escherichia coli that is sensitive to both medications she is receiving. No  other organisms are found on the sputum culture. Which of the following is the most appropriate  decision in the management of this patient’s therapy at this time?
  options:
  - Continue amikacin and imipenem.
  - Discontinue amikacin and continue imipenem.
  - Continue amikacin and imipenem, and add a macrolide.
  - Continue amikacin, discontinue imipenem and add vancomycin.
  - Continue amikacin and imipenem, and add fluconazole.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Based on her history, and clinical and laboratory data, this patient has late-onset ( > 5 days in  the hospital) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and presents risk factors for multidrugresistant pathogens, such as immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroid use). Recent  evidence suggests that antipseudomonal β-lactam monotherapy is sufficient if there is a low  prevalence of multidrug-resistant, Gram-negative bacteria locally. However, aminoglycosides  should still be combined with the β-lactam antibiotic in the initial treatment of VAP. This patient  showed signs of a clinical response to treatment with lower temperature and clearer sputum.  Lung function and radiological improvement may take longer to improve. According to guidelines for the management of VAP, antibiotic de-escalation is indicated.

  input: Which of the following conditions warrants/warrant preventive therapy for patients known to have  latent tuberculosis infection?
  options:
  - Treatment with tumour necrosis factor-α blocking agents
  - Patients on an organ transplant list
  - Pregnancy
  - Chronic renal failure scheduled for dialysis
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - B
  - D
  rationale: 'Immunosuppression due to solid-organ transplantation has an odds ratio of 20–74 for developing active disease in patients with latent tuberculosis. The corresponding odds ratios are  1.5–17 in patients on tumour necrosis factor-α treatment and 10–25 in patients with chronic  renal failure on dialysis. Therefore, preventive chemotherapy is recommended in these conditions. Latent tuberculosis in uncomplicated pregnancy does not justify immediate treatment,  although isoniazid preventive therapy is considered safe. In low-burden countries, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend  latent tuberculosis screening only for high-risk women: those with known or suspected tuberculosis contacts, injection drug use, HIV or other immunosuppression, being born in a high incidence country, and/or residence in communal institutions. Pregnancy by itself is not considered  high risk. In high-burden countries, latent tuberculosis screening is not routinely recommended,  though
    tuberculosis skin test screening is useful in HIV-infected patients for identifying those  most likely to benefit from isoniazid preventive therapy. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend routine use of interferon-γ release  assays (IGRAs) for latent tuberculosis screening, and neither WHO nor the CDC have commented on IGRAs in pregnancy. Active tuberculosis in pregnancy is treated with a standard regimen and supplementation of  pyridoxine (50 mg daily); streptomycin and prothionamide should be avoided.'

  input: Which of the following statements regarding manifestations and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) is/are correct?
  options:
  - Pleural involvement is more common than parenchymal manifestations.
  - RA-associated interstitial lung disease is more common in females than in males.
  - Patients with anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are at increased risk for the development of extra-articular RA.
  - Adalimumab therapy of RA may cause interstitial pneumonia.
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Pulmonary involvement in RA is common, although pleural involvement is most frequent.  Pulmonary involvement includes airway disease, nodules and parenchymal infiltration with a  usual interstitial or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern. Rheumatoid nodules are frequently located in the periphery of the right middle or both upper lobes, and range from several  millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. Pulmonary involvement is particularly common  in males and in patients with high-titre rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated peptide  antibodies. Pulmonary disease may also occur as a side-effect of drugs used to treat RA, such as  adalimumab (tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor) or methotrexate.

  input: A 46-year-old female receives a platelet transfusion because of severe thrombocytopenia after  adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. 3 h later, she complains of an acute onset of shortness  of breath. SpO2 is 76%, and arterial blood gas analysis reveals PaO2 of 5.99 kPa (45 mmHg), PaCO2  of 3.33 kPa (25 mmHg) and pH 7.50. Her blood pressure is 148/80 mmHg, heart rate is regular  at 118 beats per min and temperature is 37.8°C. The patient is transferred to the intensive care  unit and she is placed on NIV (spontaneous timed mode, inspiratory oxygen fraction 0.6, expiratory  positive airway pressure (EPAP) 6 cmH2O, inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) 14 cmH2O,  frequency 15 breaths per min and inspiratory time 1.5 s). The chest radiograph shows bilateral  pulmon ary infiltrates. Arterial blood gases after 1 h on NIV are PaO2 8.25 kPa (62 mmHg), PaCO2  3.72 kPa (28 mmHg) and pH 7.48. What is the next appropriate step in the management of this patient?
  options:
  - Intubate and place the patient on invasive mechanical ventilation
  - Decrease EPAP to 4 cmH2O
  - Request an echocardiography
  - Increase IPAP to 16 cmH2O
  - Proceed with current management
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: The patient suffers from a transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI) that occurs most often after  platelet transfusion (one TRALI per 400 units platelets, one TRALI per 5000 units packed red blood  cells). The treatment is largely supportive and consists of ventilator support as well as restrictive  fluid replacement. Since the hypoxaemic respiratory failure has improved after 1 h on NIV, there  is no need to increase pressure support (IPAP) or to intubate and place the patient on invasive  mechanical ventilation. Since TRALI is often transient and improves within hours, antibiotics and  a cardiology work-up seem premature at this stage.

  input: A 42-year-old woman who abuses intravenous drugs has a cough, blood-streaked sputum and  a temperature of 38.8°C. She has lost 13 kg over the past 3 months. Chest radiography shows a  right upper lobe infiltrate with cavitation. Three sputum smears are positive for acid-fast bacilli and  culture results are pending. Gram staining of her sputum shows numerous leukocytes and scant  Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The tuberculin skin test shows 0 mm induration at 48 h. The CD4+  T-cell count is 4.9 × 108 per L. Her serum is positive for antibodies to HIV. The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary infection due to which one of the following?
  options:
  - Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare
  - Mycobacterium kansasii
  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  - Staphylococcus aureus
  - Mixed anaerobic bacteria
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: Patients with HIV infection, even in early stages, and i.v. drug abusers are at high risk of  tuberculosis, both because of drug use alone and because of HIV-related immunosuppression.  The duration of symptoms, features of the pulmonary lesion and three positive sputum smears  support the hypothesis of a tuberculous infection, rather than Staphylococcus or mixed anaerobic  bacteria pneumonia. HIV patients could have reduced sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test (TST),  primarily attributable to a ‘switch off’ of TST responsiveness (i.e. an all-or-nothing phenomenon).  There may be an additional gradual decrease in reaction size with decreasing CD4+ cell count.  Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) most often cause disseminated disease in advanced HIVinfection, with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and M. kansasii accounting for the majority  of disseminated NTM cases. HIV-infected patients with disseminated MAC typically present  with fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue,
    diarrhoea and abdominal pain, and may have  lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly. The diagnosis of disseminated MAC  requires isolation of the organism from blood, lymph node, bone marrow or other sterile sites.

  input: By which one of the following is pulmonary emphysema most reliably diagnosed?
  options:
  - Single-breath TLCO
  - Typical angled forced expiratory flow–volume curve
  - Alveolar–arterial oxygen tension difference at maximal exercise
  - The ratio of residual volume to TLC measured by whole-body plethysmography
  - Quantitative HRCT of the lung
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: Hayhurst et al. (1984) demonstrated a significant correlation between lower attenuation levels  in in vivo quantitative CT and pathological emphysema assessment in patients scheduled for  removal of peripheral bronchial carcinoma. Since then, CT technology has been continuously  developed to allow not only quantification of emphysematous destruction but also distinction  between different emphysema types (panlobular, centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema)  and associated alterations in airways. While single-breath TLCO can be reduced in advanced  emphysema, there are other possible causes, like interstitial lung disease and pulmonary  oedema, that may also impair diffusion. The typical forced expiratory flow–volume curve with  an inflection point is a sign of the bronchial collapse that occurs with advanced COPD. In itself,  it is not related to the presence and degree of emphysema and does therefore not allow to  diagnose emphysema. As stated above, TLCO can be reduced with
    advanced emphysema. The  alveolar–arterial oxygen tension gradient can be increased in emphysema due to a reduced  gas-exchange surface because of capillary damage, which is most pronounced during exercise,  when increased cardiac output induces diffusion limitation. Ventilation–perfusion mismatch,  right-to-left shunt and diffusion impairment due to interstitial inflammation or fibrosis may  also cause gas exchange impairment. Therefore, the alveolar–arterial oxygen tension difference  at maximal exercise is not a specific measure to diagnose emphysema. Typically, there is a  raised residual volume/TLC ratio in emphysema. However, residual volume measurements can  be falsely elevated due to abdominal gas and TLC can be reduced due to concomitant restrictive lung disease. Quantitative HRCT allows a direct assessment of the presence, degree, and  distribution of emphysema.

  input: A 55-year-old healthy, non-smoking, HIV-negative native European woman with no known exposure  to persons with tuberculosis has a tuberculin skin test as part of a routine check-up examination.  Induration of 18 mm is noted. Her chest radiograph is normal. What is the appropriate medication regimen for this person?
  options:
  - Isoniazid daily for 12 months
  - Isoniazid and rifampicin daily for 4 months
  - Rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol daily for 4 months
  - Pyrazinamide and ciprofloxacin daily for 6 months
  - No anti-tuberculous medications
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: The goal of testing for latent tuberculosis infection is to identify individuals who are at increased  risk for developing active tuberculosis and would therefore benefit from preventive treatment.  This healthy woman has no risk factors for reactivation of tuberculosis and therefore should not  have been tested, and thus should not receive treatment regardless of the test result. Moreover,  her age indicates that she may have received bacille Calmette–Guérin vaccination in early childhood, which can also explain her tuberculin skin test reaction. None of the proposed regimens is  recommended for preventive therapy. Isoniazid prophylaxis is associated with increasing sideeffects with age above 35 years.

  input: Individuals with which of the following α1-antitrypsin phenotypes are at highest risk of developing  emphysema?
  options:
  - PiMS
  - PiMZ
  - PiSS
  - PiSZ
  - PiZZ
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: The Z and S variants of the α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) locus (SERPINA1) are associated with α1-AT  deficiency, which is more pronounced with the Z variant. The PiZZ phenotype is associated  with profound α1-AT deficiency (serum α1-AT levels of 2.5–7.0 μM) and the highest risk of  emphysema. All other phenotypes have been associated with reduced serum α1-AT levels. An  increased risk of emphysema has been shown for PiMZ and PiSZ, although less than for PiZZ.  There is a paucity of data on the risk of emphysema in PiMS and PiSS but a hypothetical risk  (if any) would be expected to be much lower than in the PiZZ population. Smoking, and possibly  other external factors, dramatically increase the risk of emphysema in these populations;  however, these influences are not changing the ranking of the magnitude of risk.

  input: Which statement concerning malignant mesothelioma is correct?
  options:
  - Cytology of pleural fluid is the recommended diagnostic test for mesothelioma.
  - Immunohistochemical stains help distinguish it from adenocarcinoma.
  - Fibrosarcomatous histology is more common than epithelial type.
  - Median survival for untreated patients is approximately 2 years.
  - Surgical resection is clearly beneficial in most patients.
  correct_answer: B
  rationale: Cytology of pleural fluid has a sensitivity for mesothelioma that ranges from 33–84%, and there  is often confusion between malignant mesothelial cells and metastatic adenocarcinoma cells.  European Respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines advise not to  make a diagnosis of mesothelioma based only on pleural fluid cytology because of the high risk  of diagnostic error. In case of cytological suspicion or evidence of mesothelioma, pleural biopsy  for tissue confirmation should be carried out. Immunohistochemical characteristics may help  to corroborate the diagnosis (cytokeratin 5/6, calretinin and WT-1 are positive in mesothelioma;  the adenocarcinoma markers CEA, Ber-Ep4 and LeuM1 Bg8 are negative in mesothelioma).  Epithelioid subtype is more common (60%). Median survival is under 2 years, 4–13 months for  untreated patients. Surgery is indicated only in a small number of patients, usually those with  limited epithelioid mesothelioma and good performance
    status.

He is on long-term oxygen treatment at 2 L⋅min−1. 2 months ago, his arterial blood gases on  2 L⋅min−1 oxygen were PaO2 8.6 kPa (65 mmHg), PaCO2 7.4 kPa (56 mmHg) and pH 7.38. On admission, he has increased cough newly productive of yellow sputum. His sputum volume  has decreased from 10–15 mL per day to 5–10 mL per day. His medications include inhaled ipratropium and salbutamol. On physical examination, the patient’s pulse rate is 110 beats per min,  respiration rate is 36 breaths per min and blood pressure is 146/76 mmHg.

  - Systemic corticosteroids
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: This patient suffers from acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure with respiratory acidosis due to exacerbated severe COPD. He is on long-term oxygen treatment at 2 L⋅min−1. NIV  decreases mortality and eases respiratory symptoms in patients with acute COPD exacerbations  with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Systemic steroids, dual bronchodilator inhalation and antibiotics are standard treatment for acute COPD exacerbations. Increasing the supplemental oxygen from 2 to 4 L⋅min−1 may be dangerous because the hypoxic  respiratory drive may be damped so that the hypercapnia will increase and the respiratory acidosis will worsen; the patient may lose consciousness due to carbon dioxide narcosis.

  input: A 45-year-old HIV-positive male (CD4 cells 2.50 × 108 per L), is referred to you because of a tuberculin skin test with 7-mm induration. He has no specific complaints, has not had contact with  tuberculosis patients in the past, and has not had a Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination.  Chest radiography is normal. Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step?
  options:
  - Perform an inteferon-γ release assay (IGRA).
  - No further action is necessary at this time.
  - Repeat the skin test if CD4 cells fall below 2.00 × 108 per L.
  - Prophylactic therapy with isoniazid for 6 months.
  - Prophylactic therapy with isoniazid for 9 months.
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: In patients with HIV infection, a tuberculin skin test showing an induration of >5 mm should be  interpreted as positive. As the patient did not have a BCG vaccination, an IGRA test is not necessary to confirm the tuberculin skin test. If active tuberculosis is ruled out clinically and by chest  radiography, prophylactic therapy with isoniazid for 9 months is recommended.

  input: A 41-year-old woman receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids is referred with a diagnosis  of ‘refractory asthma’. In the preceding 6 months, she has been treated in the emergency room  for abrupt, acute, short-lived episodes of apparent life-threatening asthma attacks. She has  never smoked. Her asthma symptoms began after the death of her brother. While discussing her   brother’s death, she becomes agitated and suddenly develops an acute attack. Her blood pressure  is 140/70 mmHg, pulse rate is 88 beats per min and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per min. On  auscultation, wheezes are noted over the anterior portions of her chest. Her arterial blood gases are  PaO2 9.8 kPa (74 mmHg), PaCO2 4.8 kPa (36 mmHg) and pH 7.42. Which of the following is most likely to provide a correct diagnosis in this patient?
  options:
  - Transnasal laryngoscopy after exercise
  - Flow–volume curves after breathing cold air
  - Flow–volume curves during an attack
  - Methacholine challenge test after an attack
  - Transnasal laryngoscopy after methacholine inhalation
  correct_answer: C
  rationale: The beginning of symptoms after an emotional stress and development of an attack during  a discussion suggest vocal cord dysfunction (VCD), more likely than ‘refractory asthma’.  Furthermore, on clinical examination, wheezes are only noted over the anterior portion of the  chest. VCD is a condition characterised by abnormal adduction of the vocal cords. The clinical  presentation of VCD is commonly mistaken for asthma and patients with VCD are frequently  misdiagnosed as having poorly controlled or exercise-induced asthma, and their response to  standard asthma therapy is generally poor. A psychological origin for VCD has been established  and emotional stress is a common precipitant of psychogenic VCD. Flow–volume loop recording  during spirometry can reveal the characteristic flattening or truncation of the inspiratory limb  that is consistent with variable extrathoracic obstruction, but this finding is generally absent  unless patients are acutely symptomatic. Visualisation
    of the vocal cords with laryngoscopy during an acute VCD episode is the recommended procedure to confirm diagnosis. The methacoline challenge test is normally negative  even if episodes of methacoline-induced vocal cord adduction are reported. In patients suspected of exercise-induced VCD, laryngoscopy is typically performed before and after exercise,  although laryngoscopy during exercise testing is reported.

  - Larger size of the nodule
  correct_answer:
  - A
  - C
  - D
  rationale: Recent evidence has shown that smoking history, female sex, older age and larger nodule size  (together with family history of lung cancer, emphysema, location of the nodule in the upper  lobe, part-solid nodule type, lower nodule count, and spiculation) are predictive of malignancy  of a solitary pulmonary nodule found on a CT scan. Predictive models have been developed  based on these variables.

  input: Which of the following statements about OSAS is false?
  options:
  - Upper airway resistance is increased during sleep.
  - Apnoeas, hypopnoeas and respiratory effort-related arousals are found.
  - Sympathetic activity is increased both during sleep and wakefulness.
  - Hypoxaemia attenuates the effects of increased sympathetic tone.
  - OSAS is a risk factor for arterial hypertension.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: OSAS is a common disorder affecting 5–10% of the adult population. Patients are frequently  obese. The disorder is characterised by repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep  leading to hypoxia, resulting in activation of the sympathetic system. Upper airway resistance  increases when the airway collapses. Sleep cycles become disturbed and apnoeas, hypopnoeas  and arousals in association with increased breathing efforts (respiratory effort-related arousals)  are characteristic of the disease. An increase in sympathetic tone is also maintained during  wakefulness when the disease progresses. One of the main drivers of the sympathetic tone elevation is the repeated cycles of hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia by itself is known to enhance, and not  to attenuate, sympathetic activity. Elevated sympathetic tone is a major cause of the increase in  cardiovascular risk including hypertension.

  input: Which of the following statements is/are correct regarding exercise physiology and ventilation?
  options:
  - Healthy subjects are able to sustain V′E at 70% of their maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV)  for ≥15 min.
  - Patients with COPD have reduced ventilatory reserves and increased ventilatory requirements  for a given level of exercise.
  - During exercise, dead space to tidal volume ratio decreases in normal subjects, but may  increase in patients with COPD.
  - The ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (V′E/V′CO2) is a measure of the efficiency of carbon  dioxide elimination, and is usually elevated in patients with COPD.
  correct_answer:
  - B
  - C
  - D
  rationale: The ratio of V′E divided by the maximum voluntary ventilation (V′Emax/MVV) of 0.70 can be sustained for 15 min in normal individuals, but values above 0.75 are usually not attained even at  peak exercise because there is cardiac limitation in untrained individuals. In contrast, ventilatory  limitation at peak exercise occurs in obstructive and restrictive lung disease. It is judged to occur  when V′Emax/MVV exceeds 85%, particularly if respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis  is not evident. The ventilatory reserve is usually reduced or absent in COPD at peak exercise. A high V′E for  a given V′CO2 is frequently observed in patients with COPD, due to the increased deadspace  fraction of tidal volume and a reduced PaCO2 because of arterial hypoxaemia and premature  metabolic acidosis.

  input: 'A 61-year-old woman who has severe COPD seeks advice about taking an international flight.  Spirometry yields the following values: FVC 2.8 L (78% predicted); FEV1 0.7 L (29% predicted); arterial blood gases breathing air at sea level are PaO2 6.50 kPa (49 mmHg), SaO2 85%, PaCO2 6.10 kPa  (46 mmHg), and pH 7.38. These values are very similar to those of 6 and 12 months ago. You should advise the patient:'
  options:
  - Not to travel on a commercial airliner.
  - That she will maintain satisfactory oxygenation during the flight since she will hyperventilate.
  - To use on-board oxygen carried by commercial airlines if shortness of breath develops.
  - To make advance arrangements with the airline for physician-prescribed in-flight oxygen.
  - Additional oxygen is not warranted since commercial airline cabins are pressurised to sea level.
  correct_answer: D
  rationale: Air travel is almost always feasible with appropriate medical support, but this may involve considerable costs. The patient will become more hypoxaemic during the flight as hyperventilation  will only partially compensate for the reduced barometric pressure in the cabin. In this woman,  oxygen should be recommended at a flow rate of 2–4 L ⋅ min−1 via nasal cannula during the flight  even if she is not short of breath as she is already hypoxaemic at sea level. Arrangements for  in-flight oxygen have to be made with the airline in advance. A hypoxaemic challenge test with  an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.15 may aid decision-making on the supplemental oxygen  flow rate required, but the relevance of these observations has not been validated by clinical  outcomes.

  input: A 60-year-old homeless male is brought to the emergency department because of severe dyspnoea. The patient states that he can hardly walk anymore because of shortness of breath. This  makes it difficult for him to purchase and carry his daily amount of two to three bottles of wine to  his shelter. He occasionally smokes if he manages to get some cigarettes. Until he lost his home  10 years ago, he never smoked and only drank occasionally. His medical history is uneventful apart  from tonsillectomy in childhood. During transfer from the ambulance stretcher to the hospital  bed, he becomes cyanotic and more dyspnoeic as soon he is in upright position. The patient also  has jaundice, digital clubbing and spider naevi. Physical examination shows some basilar wheeze.  Cardiac auscultation is normal. The liver appears to be small; the spleen is of normal size and there  are no signs of ascites or abdominal varices. Hepatojugular reflux is negative. Laboratory tests show  moderately elevated
    liver enzymes (alanine transaminase 312 U ⋅ L−1) and normal C-reactive protein. Hb concentration is 10.1 g⋅dL−1 with a mean cellular volume of 107 fL. The leukocyte count  is normal. PaO2 on room air in sitting position is 8.1 kPa (61 mmHg), PaCO2 is 4.3 kPa (32 mmHg)  and pH is 7.42. What is the most likely diagnosis?
  options:
  - COPD
  - Portopulmonary hypertension
  - Weber–Rendu–Osler disease
  - Acute left ventricular failure
  - Hepatopulmonary syndrome
  correct_answer: E
  rationale: (HPS) refers to the triad of hepatic disease, impaired oxygenation  and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. The mechanism of pathogenesis remains controversial but hepatic endothelin and nitric oxide overproduction have been suggested. This leads  to pulmonary vascular dilatation, with nonuniform perfusion and increased shunting volume,  which worsens in the upright position. Therefore, HPS typically manifests with platypnoea and  orthodeoxia. The diagnosis of pulmonary arteriovenous shunts can be made by echocardiography after injection of saline containing air bubbles. The bubbles pass through the enlarged  pulmonary blood vessels after four to six cardiac cycles. This patient exhibits classic HPS. There is evidence of chronic liver failure, but no signs of portal  hypertension. Acute left ventricular failure would show a jugular venous distension and a positive hepatojugular reflux, and orthopnoea instead of platypnoea and orthodeoxia. Even though  Morbus Osler–Rendu syndrome
    can have a similar clinical presentation as HPS because of  intrapulmonary shunts, there would be oral teleangiectasis instead of the spider naevi and signs  of liver failure. COPD is unlikely, considering the limited cigarette smoke exposure and lack of  correlation with the other symptoms.
